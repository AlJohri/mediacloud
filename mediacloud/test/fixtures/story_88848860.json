Nowadays in the state Republican Party the bus has been replaced by a giant tea cup. \n\n\n\n on the State Board of Education. \n\n \n\n     The East Lansing Republican shuffled off to the state GOP convention last weekend to nail down that nomination. As the incumbent she had endorsements coming out of her ears; former Florida governor Jeb Bush sent a glowing letter. The DeVos family checked in as did the governor and other notables in the party. \n\n \n\n     Problem is that stuff doesn’t mean squat in the newly reconstituted Michigan Republican Party where the Tea Party wing basically snubbed its collective nose at the endorsements. It elected two of its own, leaving Ms. Danhoff to wonder what went wrong. \n\n \n\n    The two Tea Party people who wanted the state board nominations - Todd Courser and Melanie Kurdys - at first thought one of them would have to bow out since it was pretty clear Ms. Danhoff would get the nod. \n\n \n\n      But the longer they talked and the more votes they counted, it became clear there was no need for one of them to bail out.  They would simply go for the two nominations and leave Danhof out in the cold. \n\n \n\n      And that’s exactly what happened. \n\n \n\n       Ms. Danhoff rebuffs the notion that she did not work the grassroots and pay homage to the new power brokers who apparently have the votes to do pretty much what they so desire.  So far they have taken out the National Committeeman Saul Anuzis, MSU Board of Trustee Don Nugent and now Ms. Danhoff. \n\n \n\n      She contends she attended many Lincoln Day dinners, many Women’s Federation conclaves and many executive committee meetings. She reports she never saw the two folks who beat her. \n\n \n\n       Didn’t matter. \n\n \n\n       So is she worried about the direction her beloved party is taking?  Of course she is, but she won’t discuss it now for fear it will split the party during this election year.     Let’s just say she is biting her tongue after this un-ceremonial shellacking she took from a tea cup. \n\n\n\n","description":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTwo Tea Party candidates for the state Board of Education were nominated - and the incumbent got the boot.\n\t\t\n\t<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?a=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?a=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?i=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?a=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?a=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?i=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?a=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/saginaw_opinion?i=UN_oTmHps7E:VGUWmtaZnRQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/saginaw_opinion/~4/UN_oTmHps7E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>","story_texts_id":null,"fully_extracted":1,"media_id":1490,"publish_date":"2012-09-11 20:13:04","story_sentences":[],"stories_id":88848860,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/saginaw_opinion/~3/UN_oTmHps7E/tim_skubick_last_weekends_mich.html","guid":"tag:www.mlive.com,2012:/politics/index.ssf//3203.8992429","title":"Tim Skubick: Last weekend's Michigan GOP convention proves Tea Party still holds sway"}]
