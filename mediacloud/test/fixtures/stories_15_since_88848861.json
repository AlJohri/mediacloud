   </script>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div><p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It is becoming increasingly necessary for <a href=\"/topic/teens\" class=\"inline_link\">teens</a> to have part time <a href=\"/jobs\" class=\"inline_link\">jobs</a> they can work at after school, on weekends and during school vacations. Doing so allows them to earn their own money for clothing and school supplies, as well as for gas and other transportation needs. An after school job also aids in teaching teens to be more responsible.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When teens are bringing in their own money, parents are better able to concentrate on paying the rent and utilities. They are also able to feed their family better because money is not as tight.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">There are many opportunities for teens to fill out applications at restaurants and local stores, but the competition may be high because there are so many adults looking for work as well. A teenager may choose to start her own business, building skills necessary in the adult world.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Options for your teen to consider include:</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Yard Work:</strong> During the winter months, this will mean shoveling. During the spring, they will be cleaning up after the winter months, landscaping and possibly starting gardens. In the summer, mowing lawns and trimming are necessary tasks, as is weeding. And fall will include tasks such as preparing garden beds for next spring, and raking lawns.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Babysitting: </strong>Every teenager who babysits should take a babysitting course, as well as first aid and CPR courses. Check your local YMCA to see if they offer these. Planning activities for the children each day is a must.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> The elderly, people who are recuperating from injuries and illnesses, and single parents will all benefit from having someone come to their homes to perform regular cleaning tasks such as dusting, dishes, vacuuming and cleaning the bathroom on a daily or weekly basis.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Personal Assistant:</strong> This type of job will depend on your experience as well as other factors. People need different things. A writer may need someone to perform office tasks, as well as to shop for her business. A single mom might want someone to do her grocery shopping and help her with other tasks she is too busy to get to during the day, such as menu planning and list making.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Be sure to subscribe to Bangor <a href=\"/topic/frugal-living\" class=\"inline_link\">Frugal Living</a> to receive all new updates to the column.

Doing so allows them to earn their own money for clothing and school supplies, as well as for gas and other transportation needs. An after school job also aids in teaching teens to be more responsible. \n\n \n\n When teens are bringing in their own money, parents are better able to concentrate on paying the rent and utilities. They are also able to feed their family better because money is not as tight. \n\n \n\n There are many opportunities for teens to fill out applications at restaurants and local stores, but the competition may be high because there are so many adults looking for work as well. A teenager may choose to start her own business, building skills necessary in the adult world. \n\n \n\n Options for your teen to consider include: \n\n \n\n  Yard Work:  During the winter months, this will mean shoveling. During the spring, they will be cleaning up after the winter months, landscaping and possibly starting gardens. In the summer, mowing lawns and trimming are necessary tasks, as is weeding. And fall will include tasks such as preparing garden beds for next spring, and raking lawns. \n\n \n\n  Babysitting:  Every teenager who babysits should take a babysitting course, as well as first aid and CPR courses. Check your local YMCA to see if they offer these. Planning activities for the children each day is a must. \n\n \n\n  Housekeeping:  The elderly, people who are recuperating from injuries and illnesses, and single parents will all benefit from having someone come to their homes to perform regular cleaning tasks such as dusting, dishes, vacuuming and cleaning the bathroom on a daily or weekly basis. \n\n \n\n  Personal Assistant:  This type of job will depend on your experience as well as other factors. People need different things. A writer may need someone to perform office tasks, as well as to shop for her business. A single mom might want someone to do her grocery shopping and help her with other tasks she is too busy to get to during the day, such as menu planning and list making. \n\n \n\n Be sure to subscribe to Bangor  Frugal Living  to receive all new updates to the column.

Tattoos and body piercings are becoming more popular and may be promoted by celebrities such as  tattoo  artist, model and television personality Katherine von Drachenberg, also known as  Kat Von D . However, employee appearance is as much a part of the work environment as any other aspect of the  workplace  and employers are implementing dress codes that include tattoos and piercings. Courts have allowed employers to enforce these codes as long as it does not encroach on religious practice. \n\n\n\n \n\n Yes they can, says David Barron, an attorney with Cozen O’Connor in Houston. He told   SHRM Online   that Walt Disney World, SeaWorld Orlando and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have policies on tattoos. Disney does not permit its employees to use bandages to cover their tattoos, but they can use opaque makeup. SeaWorld specifies “non-conservative, large or offensive tattoos” and that tattoos will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Wal-Mart specifies that tattoos “that are offensive or distractive are to be covered by clothing or other means.” \n\n\n\n \n\n Yes, says Tamara Devitt, managing partner at labor law firm Fisher & Phillips in Los Angeles, as quoted in   SHRM Online  . A cashier at Costco had an eyebrow ring at the time Costco was revising its  dress code  prohibiting all facial jewelry to promote a professional appearance in its stores. \n\n \n\n The cashier claimed her eyebrow ring was part of her religion, the Church of Body Modification, and she refused to remove it and sued. The court said, “Her facial jewelry influenced Costco’s public image and, in Costco’s calculation, detracted from its professionalism.” That was a business determination within Costco’s discretion, according to the court. \n\n \n\n It should be noted that there are cases where tattoo or piercing reflects an employee’s genuine religious belief, and the employer must accommodate that belief unless it imposes undue hardship on the business. \n\n\n\n \n\n Yes you can, says Devitt. Prohibiting provocative dress in the workplace “often ties in with the employer creating a workplace free of harassment.” \n\n \n\n Tattoos may be offensive to other employees, like a Confederate flag, for example, and must be “dealt with the same way an offensive picture, e-mail or poster would be dealt with. If it's offensive, it should not be allowed in the company.” \n\n\n\n \n\n Devitt cautions that banning tattoos and piercings outright may be fine for some employers, but “a  policy  that is too prohibitive will keep out employees that employers might otherwise want to hire.

Break the ice. Get the people you are talking to on comfortable ground by asking them about themselves. \n\n \n\n Next, respect the people you are talking to. This is done by maintaining eye contact, being interested in what they say and sharing information. You should be as open and honest with your conversational partners as you would want them to be with you. Be willing to reveal the kind of information that you are asking of the other person. \n\n \n\n To be a good speaker, you must be a good listener. This is more than just a matter of showing interest. Careful listening makes you better able to respond when it’s your turn. Good follow-up questions are the mark of a good conversationalist. \n\n \n\n Don’t ask “yes” or “no” questions. Ask “why?” and “what if?” \n\n \n\n The top seven traits of good communicators: \n\n \n\n  They look at things from a new angle.  They take unexpected points of view on familiar subjects. \n\n \n\n  They have broad horizons.  They think and talk about a wide range of issues and experiences beyond their own daily lives. \n\n \n\n  They don’t talk about themselves all the time.  To hold up your end of the conversation, you obviously have to tell your partner something about yourself and answer questions he or she may ask. However, do not go on too long. Turn the conversation around with a “How about you?” \n\n \n\n  They are curious.   They ask “why?” They want to know more about what you are telling them. The best conversationalists have an endless curiosity about everything. They are always eager to learn something new. \n\n \n\n  They empathize.  Good communicators put themselves in your place. They aim to relate with what you are saying. The people we most enjoy talking to are those who can relate to what we are feeling – it draws out responses and gets people to be more open. \n\n \n\n T hey are enthusiastic.  They communicate a passion for what they are doing with their lives and an interest in you and your life as well. If you project enthusiasm to people you are talking to, they will be more interested in what you have to say. \n\n\n\n     \n\n Patricia is an expert on women and workplace issues and has a passion for helping women make the most out of life, at home and in the workplace.

She was helping the group:  SPOT .  They rescue and adopt out cats and dogs.  Their stated mission: \n\n \n\n \n\n \"We are advocates for the  homeless dogs and cats in North County San Diego  that are at risk for euthanasia. Our goal is to save treatable, trainable, manageable and misdiagnosed animals in San Diego shelters by working with government entities, non-profit rescue groups, and our own network of volunteers to provide a system of transport, training, fostering and adoption.\" \n\n\n\n \n\n So back to the clairvoyant and   animal communicator  Colette St. Clair.  She became involved with them and offered her services at a very special fee to help raise money. Intrigued by what others were posting about their experience and then after my own with her, I believed it could be helpful to share some information about  alternative careers  and asked to interview her.  Below is part one of the two-part interview.  \n\n\n\n \n\n Roughly 300 years if I’m to count past lives! But in life, I was born ‘ in   the field’ , but it took my settling in California and feeling safe and inspired to start my practicing professionally in 2001.   \n\n\n\n \n\n In all modesty, my primary job is to take good care of myself in mind, body and spirit in order to be healthy enough to excel in my work. \n\n \n\n My career as a psychic is to help people better understand themselves, heal and grow on personal, relationship, business or creative levels. And as an expert in telepathy, I’m a conduit or a medium who helps animals, people and spirits communicate with one another.   \n\n \n\n   You recently partnered with a San Diego (Oceanside) non-profit.  Can you tell me a bit about that?   \n\n \n\n Indeed!  I teamed up with an amazing animal support group called  SPOT (Saving One Pet at a Time),  introducing them to Animal Communication by working with some of the animals in their foster care network. It improved their understanding of animals to say the least, and some even expressed that it was a life-changing experience.  So we joined forces in a campaign of course to raise funds to help the animals, but also to raise awareness. The latter was beautifully done by posting stories on  SPOT’s Facebook page.  It was a moving experience and I would do it again! \n\n\n\n \n\n Mystic Languages has broadened the world’s understanding of telepathy and offered useful tools for its applications with living people who can’t express themselves as well as people in between lives and animals. \n\n \n\n The new paradigm generates deeper insight and growth in the fields of human mind/body/spirit medicine, integrative veterinary medicine as well as psychic and spiritual healing. \n\n \n\n Mental health professionals use the knowledge to better understand and care for the minds of people with illnesses such as schizophrenia, autism, Down’s syndrome, Alzheimer, dementia and stroke damage. \n\n \n\n    Read Part Two  - the rest of the interview with Colette St. Clair about the rewards and challenges of a career as a psychic.   \n\n\n\n     \n\n Jessi LaCosta is a respected thought leader, speaker and facilitator.

By September of 2011,  Chicago had dropped to third , behind Los Angeles and New York City; however, the difference between first and third can feel nonexistent to the average worker.  One of the factors affecting how stressful cities are is traffic, and Chicago has some of the most congested traffic in the country, making already stressful workdays here even worse.  \n\n \n\n  Kathleen Hall , the founder and CEO of the  Stress Institute  in Atlanta, was quoted by Forbes in 2011 as saying, “Commuters can experience greater anxiety than fighter pilots in battle.” The long commutes and extremely heavy traffic of Chicago makes its workers more stressed than workers who don't have to fight such terrible traffic day after day. Finances also play a role; the cost of living in Chicago is high despite a sagging housing market, making people living on tight budgets feel even more stressed. \n\n \n\n These kinds of stress can lead to all kinds of  health problems , including heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and a whole host of other problems.  But for those who own a cat, there may be some relief waiting at home each evening.  Here are five ways in which having a cat help with stress: \n\n \n\n ·        Cats  are undemanding.   Contrary to popular myths and jokes about cats, they love you and give you their company without demanding very much in return.  When you’ve got a demanding job with a demanding boss, you may often feel like everybody wants something from you while nobody’s willing to give you anything in return.  Cats can relieve this feeling by giving you their love and companionship unconditionally. \n\n \n\n ·       Cats can relieve loneliness.   Truthfully, any pet can relieve loneliness just by being there, but dogs and cats, because of their affectionate natures, are better at showing that they love you no matter what.  After an especially bad day at work, coming home to a loving cat that twines itself around your ankles  can make you feel less isolated and alone.   You can even vent at your cat—being careful not to raise your voice—and they’ll listen to every word without pointing out everything you’re wrong about, or telling you to \"just deal with it.\" \n\n \n\n ·       Cats can make you laugh.   How often has your cat leaped at absolutely nothing, made weird little chirping sounds while looking out the window, or done something else that you found so silly you just had to laugh?   According to an article by staff at the Mayo Clinic , laughter is not just good for short-term  stress relief ; it’s also good for long-term stress relief. \n\n \n\n ·       Rhythmic stroking not only feels good to your cat, it can relieve your own anxiety.   The soft feel of a cat’s fur and the repetitive motion of petting can soothe even the worst stress.  It doesn’t require any thinking on your part, and can be a bonding experience as it reminds your cat of being washed by its mother.  Stroking your cat’s fur can make it purr,  which can be even more calming for you.  \n\n \n\n ·       Cats often seem to know when something is wrong.   Have you ever come home from work so upset that all you wanted was to curl up in bed and shut the entire world out forever?  Cats can sense by your behavior, and even by your scent, that there’s a problem.  Oftentimes they behave as though they want to comfort you; they quietly pad up to you and curl up against your leg or your side, giving you their love and support.  Physical touch is both soothing and a good way to bond.  \n\n \n\n Because having a cat can help to reduce your stress level, it can help to  reduce your risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease .  It can even help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, since we’re less likely to want to reach for junk food when we’re feeling more relaxed and content. \n\n \n\n Many people feel perpetually stressed out with employers who seem to demand ever more without understanding that everyone needs to be able to relax and unwind from work in their off-time.  Does it have to be this way?  It shouldn’t.  Ideally, you should be able go to work, do your job, come home  and leave your job   at your job.   However, with ever-increasing stress levels at work, people are finding it more difficult to relax when they get home.  Having a cat around can help you to relax better, which will ultimately help you be a more productive employee  and  a healthier person overall.  \n\n \n\n  Follow me on  Facebook  and  Twitter , or feel free to subscribe!    \n\n\n\n     \n\n Eve-Angeline Mitchell has been around cats all of her life, having grown up with and raised many cats, including an abused cat and had problems with both trust and anxiety, and a broken tail that had healed badly.

Well no more procrastination.  Think again.  Below you will find a few professions that in as little as two years of schooling, you would be able to slip right into one of these professions and you don't need a bachelor's degree to do it.  Ready? \n\n \n\n  Medical Assistant:   A medical assistant can be in a number of facilities from doctors office to nursing homes.  As a way to cut costs, doctors are expected to hire more medical assistant professionals than nurses.  They do tasks in a doctor's office such as take patient's medical histories, vitals, schedule appointments  or even give injections as directed by the physician. Opportunities for medical assistants are growing primarily because of the aging baby boomer generation who will need more health care. There are no formal education requirements for this career.  But potential employers would probably prefer a person with formal education, possibly a certificate or earning an associate's degree in the field wouldn't hurt. \n\n \n\n  Massage Therapist:   If you like helping people \"hands on\" so to speak, massage therapy might be your niche.  Making people feel physically comfortable is just part of  the benefit of being a massage therapist.  If you are business minded, you could very well open your own spa, build your clientele and work for yourself.  Only a post secondary education program is needed with generally 500 hours or more to complete and possibly a license, depending on which state you live in.  \n\n \n\n  Medical Records and Health Information Technician:   This career is ideal for people who are detail oriented.  This job entails coding, medical terminology and categorizing patient information.  This may also include keeping and maintaining patient's health information confidential and secure. To get in on this career, only a certificate is required or an associate degree in health information technology. \n\n \n\n yahoo education \n\n\n\n     \n\n Margaret Rogers has been one of a few accomplished writers for the Voice of Hope News magazine at Hopewell MBC.

The ratio increased since 2000 when those with a bachelor’s degree had a median net worth value only twice as large as those with a high school diploma. The same thing happened to those with a graduate or professional degree compared to a high school diploma. The graduate’s net worth of 3.5 increased to 5.8 over the same period.  College graduates have greater net worth in all types of  investments  except  rental property   One great equalizer is investing in rental property. While college graduates have greater assets in stocks, mutual funds, motor vehicles, homes, IRA’s, 401K’s and other investments, high school graduates have a median worth in rental property equal or better than those with graduate degrees. Unfortunately, only 3.5 percent of high school graduates invest in rental property, while 9.7 percent of graduate degreed invest.  Net worth down 35 percent since 2005  U.S. median household net worth has declined 35 percent between 2005 and 2010. “The overall decline in net worth reflects drops in housing values and stock market indices,” said Census Bureau economist Alfred Gottschalck. The Net Worth and Asset Ownership tables are from the Survey of Income and Program Participation comparing household net worth in 2005 and 2010.  All educational groups experienced the decline.  \n\n \n\n For example, those with a high school diploma saw their median net worth fall 39 percent and those with a bachelor’s degree experienced a 32 percent decline. \n\n\n\n  View slideshow: \n\n     \n\n Robin Johnson regularly provides advice to friends, employees, and business executives.

Yesterday  at 07:06:23 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n WWU will still rank 2 or 3......  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n I would agree WW should be 2nd or 3rd if they had lost to a top  program like Linfield, but this was a stunning defeat. Buffalo State wasn't even ranked, and that program hasn't had a winning season since 2000. The Warhawks should fall out of the top five, at least, in my opinion.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nI'd say it will go  1.  Mt. Union 2.  MHB 3.  Linfield.   Then I don't know....Wesley won't drop too far and I dunno about Whitewater...they lost to a team that had already lost a game so you figure they drop quite a bit..... \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n First time I've been on here since last season, I think. What a barnburner of a game!  I like them exciting, but that was a little too much of a heart-stopper. Sheesh!  Thanks, CLU, for the live stream today.  Monrovia, I think you've got the lineup correct. That seems the most obvious scenario.  Coco \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n So, maybe Hansen didn't call it on the radio because he didn't understand what was going on, but....what OxyBob alluded to was a photographer wearing purple and yellow was on the visitor sidelines, got tangled up with a ref, so they threw a flag on our sideline. WC11 got marvelously vocal about his CLU gear. The guy started walking away, people kept jeering him (11 was classic).  The guy was last seen running away. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n I believe it fair to say that both Calu and Linfield players and staff developed more character in this one game today than many folks develop in a lifetime.  As we all know this hard fought game could have gone either way. When you have played your best and left everything you have on the field in 100 degree heat who could ask for anything more win or lose?  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Hey all, Great Win!  and as Coco said......... Sheesh! Talk about a heart stopper. To kick a fg with 5.6 sec left, on the Road for the win against #10 CLU has got to be a huge confidence builder for the Cats.    Bring on Lute week! or is it Lute weeks?  This just in from So Cal....Another flag was just thrown   Go Cats One Game at a Time \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: CamCat on  Yesterday  at 07:42:31 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Phenomenal game played by the Kingsmen today.  We were very lucky to come out alive.  Talk about 2 evenly matched teams. We were just lucky enough to be 5.8 seconds better today.  If CaLU is #10 the teams above you have to be pretty darn amazing. You guys have a fabulous team and we could have just as easily lost today.  I wish the Kingsmen the best for the remainder of the season (till we get to the play offs  )    \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nWas a real battle--Cats didn't quit and in the end came up with the win.  It was super hot down on that field--DOC and I were burning our toes off on the sidelines!  Like the facilities at CalLu but that stadium is just kind of dumb...... \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Partial eyewitness report from Thousand Oaks:  Stopped by and watched the first half of the CLU-Linfield game. Saw D O.C., Gig Harbor Cat, Wildcat11, MonroviaCat, and cawcdad. Both teams looked impressive. Wildcat11 with the call of the day, turning a Linfield penalty into a CLU penalty.  Oxy was humiliated by Menlo, 56-6. All scoring in the first half. A fumble run back for a TD. A blocked punt run back for a TD. A pick-6. 43-yard run for a TD. Oxy 0-2.  Lewis & Clark 31, Pomona 6. L&C 2-0.  Claremont lost at Rhodes, 21-7.  OxyBob \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: OxyBob on  Yesterday  at 09:10:18 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n  Claremont lost at Rhodes, 21-7.  OxyBob  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Not quite. Stags dominated the first quarter, twice driving the length of the field on time of possession 12 mins plus to lead 14-0. Rhodes bounced back in the 2d to tie at half. CMS kicked a FG at 14:51 of the 4th, but Rhodes posted a TD late. CMS drove from its 35 at 3:35 to 1st and goal at Rhodes 7 with :36 to go.  Threw incomplete twice before a blitzing Rhodes backer levelled Peter Kimmey with the scariest hit I've ever seen in person at any level.  After a long delay during which Kimmey was removed on a backboard, Soph Sean McKaveney came on for 4th + goal with :07 remaining and threw a strike to the goal line that a Lynx DB dislodged as time expired. Final from Memphis, 21-17, as the Stags come up short on the final drive for the second consecutive week.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n I was more impressed with Whittier than I was La Verne. Peterson just wasn't consistent or very effective in the passing game tonight, which is why it stayed competitive for 3 quarters. Defense stepped up and made some plays most of the night, which was more than enough to make up for some stagnant play on the other side of the ball. The pick 6's were a nice sight after watching the Poets have their way with the Pirate corners most of last week. The Defensive front 7 also did a much better job of providing consistent pressure this week. ULV QB got out of the pocket a few times and made some nice plays for the Leos, but most of the night he was running for his life. I'll take it.   I know Tully, so I know this won't happen, but McCune ought to get the start and all 4 quarters against Chapman...Peterson has yet to be effective running or throwing the ball. And he's played against some pretty bad defenses. I'm pretty sure there's a saying about doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results...  But, a win is a win, and as long as the O-line continues to play surprisingly good football, they should get another W next week against Chapman.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: DoubleDomer on  Yesterday  at 11:59:35 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Threw incomplete twice before a blitzing Rhodes backer levelled Peter Kimmey with the scariest hit I've ever seen in person at any level.

Near the end of today's CMS @ Rhodes football game, CMS quarterback Peter Kimmey was sacked and remained on the field for several minutes as sports medicine personnel evaluated his condition.  He was removed from the field, but was alert and moving at the time, and transported to a local hospital for precautionary testing.  Results of the tests were normal and he was released and should make a full recovery. \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: (509)Rat on  Today  at 12:06:49 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n So the guy had a typo. You still lost right?   \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n I apologize for the typo. I should have been more accurate: \"Claremont blows 2-touchdown lead, loses again.\"  And speaking of losing again, Redlands, playing without injured QB Chad Hurst, lost at home to Pacific Lutheran, 28-14.  Oxy 0-2. Redlands 0-2. Pomona 0-2. Claremont 0-2. La Verne 0-1. Whittier 0-1. CLU 1-1. The SCIAC's not exactly off to a rip-roaring start.  OxyBob \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Thanks for all the information because I was unable to tune into any games today.    Would greatly appreciate help with a couple of concerns:   How serious is QB Chad Hurst's injury?   Is Chapman eligible for the SCIAC title this year? Sage OxyBob didn't list Panthers in his list of teams, and Chapman being 1-0 would alleviate the SCIAC's weak start a bit.    Cheers from Downunder! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Hemingway13 on  Today  at 08:59:06 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n Thanks for all the information because I was unable to tune into any games today.

They are playing at home after all  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Recent history would suggest the Cobber homefield advantage versus St. John's applies up until the final minute, at which time perhaps some premature revelry diverts attention from finishing off the opponent, resulting in all kinds of cardiac issues for the folks in the south stands. Cobbers have actually done a better job of upsetting the Johnnies in Collegeville. That said, I have been impressed with the Concordia offense here in the early going. It seems it usually takes more games for the option to click. Baune, at fullback, is carrying the load very well, which really opens up the rest of the attack. Defense stuffed St. Olaf's running game (19 yards), and really only gave up one big pass play in the 4th quarter. The game was not as close as even the 28-14 final suggests (the last Ole touchdown coming on a pick-6 late in the 4th). Expect a barn-burner.  \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: WarhawkDad on  Yesterday  at 09:52:51 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: 02 Warhawk on  Yesterday  at 09:29:59 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Gotta love bleedpurple, he's my polar opposite.

On the down side Bethel 56 B.V. 7 and Wheaton 53 Luther 7.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Nice bounce back by Wartburg. Not surprised by that at all. Their D seemed very legit last week. And the Wheaton loss to Albion seems like an anomaly just a week later.  As for BV, not much to say. Their QB didn't impress. Bethel got a lot of pressure, but even when he did have time there were some really ugly passes. His biggest completion of the day was a pass where the 3rd string Safety had it sniffed out but mistimed his jump. It could be a long season for the Beavers.   Their D isn't great either, but the O did them no favors. Multiple times Bethel scored, the offense went 3 and out or turned it over and the D was right back on the field. That wears a D down really quickly.  Interesting stat of the game:  Only 1 penalty between the two teams against Bethel for four yards. Their were a few others thrown but none accepted. On the whole, both teams played a very disciplined, clean game. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Well, not much to say, it was an UGLY game for the Spartans today. But, looking at the glass half full, here's my take on where we go from here:  1.) Toughest non-conference schedule maybe EVER played by the Spartans and I'd rather play these tough teams and get beat then a cupcake to get a win.  2.) There is a reason that WIAC teams are so good. I think it's a little ridiculous that more WIAC teams don't get in the top 25 when about 5 teams from that conference could win almost any conference in the nation. I hate to say it but the WIAC is a step above the IIAC and until all of our \"top tier\" teams start playing them and beating them, it won't change.   3.) I know the Spartans are not as bad as the scores of the last two games might make people think. However, having said that, the mental errors, turnovers, and mistakes have got to improve. 4.) We have to learn from the last 2 games, put them behind us, and realize it's a new season starting in 2 weeks against Central.  The way I look at it, where the Spartans go from here will be the ultimate test of character and heart and I am looking forward to seeing how they respond.

Wait, they'll measure. And they got it.   Thought the Johnnies had a great shot. Didn't listen to the first half but sounded a big turn was when Johnnies were up 14-7, with the ball in Tommie territory but didn't do anything and then trailed by half by 8. Rushing game was nonexistent today.   Hopefully they can run the table but obviously several tough games to go, starting next week. Cobbers looking good.     \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\n\n Were trying to find guys who can win for us, said Gagliardi, who begins his 60th season in Collegeville, and his 64th season as a collegiate head coach, with 484 career victories  the most in college football history. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\n\n Were trying to find guys who can win for us, said Gagliardi, who begins his 60th season in Collegeville, and his 64th season as a collegiate head coach, with 484 career victories  the most in college football history. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: tmerton on  Yesterday  at 04:46:14 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: kubiack78 on  Yesterday  at 04:44:54 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n UWW loses to Buff St. 7-6  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Who's Buffalo State?  Are they D-2?  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Nope, DIII from out East. NJAC now, E8 I believe.  They've got a couple nice wins now this year. Prior to this they've been a .500 or below team for the better part of a decade.  Sounds like their D played some inspired ball. They also had two missed FG's so they were in this the whole game. Maybe they're a 2012 sleeper, maybe they caught UWW sleeping, maybe a little of both. Hard time imagining UWW has really fallen off this quickly so I'm guessing this is just shades of Bethel in 2006 v.

Wartburg actually moving the ball a bit, but can't nothing going once they get within the 30.  Really bad roughing the passer call against Bethel. Just a great hit on the QB as he threw on 3rd and 8. 1st down, but Mathis, the LB who got the PF, bounced back with an INT a couple plays later.  Physical game so far, no ones really established much so far in the run game.

Please, consider making even the smallest donation to Tom.   The following is an open letter by Retired UW-W Coach Bob Berezowitz:   Team Tom Cancer Fund Drive established   Once a Warhawk, always a Warhawk are the often spoken words by Tom Pattison, longtime voice of the Warhawks. Over the many years of broadcasting UW-Whitewater football, basketball and baseball games on KOOL 106.5 (and prior to that (940 WFAW), Tom has bled purple during each one of his broadcasts.  Unfortunately, on May 28, 2012 Tom was diagnosed with advanced stage 2 colon cancer. He underwent colorectal cancer surgery in Fort Atkinson and in the process has developed astronomical hospital and medical bills.  Tom has already gone through the first phase of radiation treatment at the UW Cancer Clinic along with chemotherapy with phase two starting later this month.  Tom has given his heart and soul to Warhawk athletics over his 25 years of living here in southern Wisconsin. He served six years as the president of the UW-Whitewater Quarterback Club and still serves on the clubs board of directors.  In 2003 Tom founded Warhawkfootball.com where Warhawk fans, players, former players and parents have been able to view up-to-date Warhawk football news and information 365 days a year. Nearly 1.5 million visitors have clicked onto the Website over the years.  The Website that has been funded entirely by Tom has been a popular voice for Warhawk football fans not only locally but around the world.  Well now Tom needs your assistance in his battle with cancer.  With the help and leadership of UW-Whitewater Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Dr. Paul Plinke and former Warhawk football coach Bob Berezowitz and KOOL 106.5 Radio a team has been set up to lead a campaign to raise funds for Tom.   The \"Team Tom Cancer Fund\" has been established through Commercial Bank in Whitewater and is now accepting donations.  Donations may be sent to: Team Tom Cancer Fund, c/o Commercial Bank, 200 South Freemont St. Whitewater, WI 53190   The fund raising drive will also include Tom Pattison Day at Perkins Stadium on Oct. 6, 2012. More details will be announced shortly.  I have known Tom for many years while coaching and now in retirement, Berezowitz said. There is not another person who has given more of himself to help promote UW-Whitewater football. He is always writing articles for both past and present players that are published on his Website.  It is now our turn to say thank you for his efforts by considering making a donation to the to assist Tom in his time of need.

Buffalo State wasn't even ranked, and that program hasn't had a winning season since 2000. The Warhawks should fall out of the top five, at least, in my opinion.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nI'd say it will go  1.  Mt. Union 2.  MHB 3.  Linfield.   Then I don't know....Wesley won't drop too far and I dunno about Whitewater...they lost to a team that had already lost a game so you figure they drop quite a bit..... \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n First time I've been on here since last season, I think. What a barnburner of a game!  I like them exciting, but that was a little too much of a heart-stopper. Sheesh!  Thanks, CLU, for the live stream today.  Monrovia, I think you've got the lineup correct. That seems the most obvious scenario.  Coco \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n So, maybe Hansen didn't call it on the radio because he didn't understand what was going on, but....what OxyBob alluded to was a photographer wearing purple and yellow was on the visitor sidelines, got tangled up with a ref, so they threw a flag on our sideline. WC11 got marvelously vocal about his CLU gear. The guy started walking away, people kept jeering him (11 was classic).  The guy was last seen running away. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n I believe it fair to say that both Calu and Linfield players and staff developed more character in this one game today than many folks develop in a lifetime.  As we all know this hard fought game could have gone either way. When you have played your best and left everything you have on the field in 100 degree heat who could ask for anything more win or lose?  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Hey all, Great Win!  and as Coco said......... Sheesh! Talk about a heart stopper. To kick a fg with 5.6 sec left, on the Road for the win against #10 CLU has got to be a huge confidence builder for the Cats.    Bring on Lute week! or is it Lute weeks?

To kick a fg with 5.6 sec left, on the Road for the win against #10 CLU has got to be a huge confidence builder for the Cats.    Bring on Lute week! or is it Lute weeks?

We were just lucky enough to be 5.8 seconds better today.  If CaLU is #10 the teams above you have to be pretty darn amazing. You guys have a fabulous team and we could have just as easily lost today.  I wish the Kingsmen the best for the remainder of the season (till we get to the play offs  )    \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nWas a real battle--Cats didn't quit and in the end came up with the win.  It was super hot down on that field--DOC and I were burning our toes off on the sidelines!  Like the facilities at CalLu but that stadium is just kind of dumb...... \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Partial eyewitness report from Thousand Oaks:  Stopped by and watched the first half of the CLU-Linfield game. Saw D O.C., Gig Harbor Cat, Wildcat11, MonroviaCat, and cawcdad. Both teams looked impressive. Wildcat11 with the call of the day, turning a Linfield penalty into a CLU penalty.  Oxy was humiliated by Menlo, 56-6. All scoring in the first half. A fumble run back for a TD. A blocked punt run back for a TD. A pick-6. 43-yard run for a TD. Oxy 0-2.  Lewis & Clark 31, Pomona 6. L&C 2-0.  Claremont lost at Rhodes, 21-7.  OxyBob \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: OxyBob on  Yesterday  at 09:10:18 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n  Claremont lost at Rhodes, 21-7.  OxyBob  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Not quite. Stags dominated the first quarter, twice driving the length of the field on time of possession 12 mins plus to lead 14-0. Rhodes bounced back in the 2d to tie at half. CMS kicked a FG at 14:51 of the 4th, but Rhodes posted a TD late. CMS drove from its 35 at 3:35 to 1st and goal at Rhodes 7 with :36 to go.  Threw incomplete twice before a blitzing Rhodes backer levelled Peter Kimmey with the scariest hit I've ever seen in person at any level.  After a long delay during which Kimmey was removed on a backboard, Soph Sean McKaveney came on for 4th + goal with :07 remaining and threw a strike to the goal line that a Lynx DB dislodged as time expired. Final from Memphis, 21-17, as the Stags come up short on the final drive for the second consecutive week.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n I was more impressed with Whittier than I was La Verne. Peterson just wasn't consistent or very effective in the passing game tonight, which is why it stayed competitive for 3 quarters. Defense stepped up and made some plays most of the night, which was more than enough to make up for some stagnant play on the other side of the ball. The pick 6's were a nice sight after watching the Poets have their way with the Pirate corners most of last week. The Defensive front 7 also did a much better job of providing consistent pressure this week. ULV QB got out of the pocket a few times and made some nice plays for the Leos, but most of the night he was running for his life. I'll take it.   I know Tully, so I know this won't happen, but McCune ought to get the start and all 4 quarters against Chapman...Peterson has yet to be effective running or throwing the ball. And he's played against some pretty bad defenses. I'm pretty sure there's a saying about doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results...  But, a win is a win, and as long as the O-line continues to play surprisingly good football, they should get another W next week against Chapman.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: DoubleDomer on  Yesterday  at 11:59:35 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Threw incomplete twice before a blitzing Rhodes backer levelled Peter Kimmey with the scariest hit I've ever seen in person at any level.

Near the end of today's CMS @ Rhodes football game, CMS quarterback Peter Kimmey was sacked and remained on the field for several minutes as sports medicine personnel evaluated his condition.  He was removed from the field, but was alert and moving at the time, and transported to a local hospital for precautionary testing.  Results of the tests were normal and he was released and should make a full recovery. \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: (509)Rat on  Today  at 12:06:49 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n So the guy had a typo.

I should have been more accurate: \"Claremont blows 2-touchdown lead, loses again.\"  And speaking of losing again, Redlands, playing without injured QB Chad Hurst, lost at home to Pacific Lutheran, 28-14.  Oxy 0-2. Redlands 0-2. Pomona 0-2. Claremont 0-2. La Verne 0-1. Whittier 0-1. CLU 1-1. The SCIAC's not exactly off to a rip-roaring start.

Would greatly appreciate help with a couple of concerns:   How serious is QB Chad Hurst's injury?   Is Chapman eligible for the SCIAC title this year? Sage OxyBob didn't list Panthers in his list of teams, and Chapman being 1-0 would alleviate the SCIAC's weak start a bit.

They are playing at home after all  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Recent history would suggest the Cobber homefield advantage versus St. John's applies up until the final minute, at which time perhaps some premature revelry diverts attention from finishing off the opponent, resulting in all kinds of cardiac issues for the folks in the south stands. Cobbers have actually done a better job of upsetting the Johnnies in Collegeville. That said, I have been impressed with the Concordia offense here in the early going. It seems it usually takes more games for the option to click. Baune, at fullback, is carrying the load very well, which really opens up the rest of the attack. Defense stuffed St. Olaf's running game (19 yards), and really only gave up one big pass play in the 4th quarter. The game was not as close as even the 28-14 final suggests (the last Ole touchdown coming on a pick-6 late in the 4th). Expect a barn-burner.  \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: WarhawkDad on  Yesterday  at 09:52:51 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: 02 Warhawk on  Yesterday  at 09:29:59 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Gotta love bleedpurple, he's my polar opposite.

On the down side Bethel 56 B.V. 7 and Wheaton 53 Luther 7.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Nice bounce back by Wartburg. Not surprised by that at all. Their D seemed very legit last week. And the Wheaton loss to Albion seems like an anomaly just a week later.  As for BV, not much to say. Their QB didn't impress. Bethel got a lot of pressure, but even when he did have time there were some really ugly passes. His biggest completion of the day was a pass where the 3rd string Safety had it sniffed out but mistimed his jump. It could be a long season for the Beavers.   Their D isn't great either, but the O did them no favors. Multiple times Bethel scored, the offense went 3 and out or turned it over and the D was right back on the field. That wears a D down really quickly.  Interesting stat of the game:  Only 1 penalty between the two teams against Bethel for four yards. Their were a few others thrown but none accepted. On the whole, both teams played a very disciplined, clean game. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Well, not much to say, it was an UGLY game for the Spartans today. But, looking at the glass half full, here's my take on where we go from here:  1.) Toughest non-conference schedule maybe EVER played by the Spartans and I'd rather play these tough teams and get beat then a cupcake to get a win.  2.) There is a reason that WIAC teams are so good. I think it's a little ridiculous that more WIAC teams don't get in the top 25 when about 5 teams from that conference could win almost any conference in the nation. I hate to say it but the WIAC is a step above the IIAC and until all of our \"top tier\" teams start playing them and beating them, it won't change.   3.) I know the Spartans are not as bad as the scores of the last two games might make people think. However, having said that, the mental errors, turnovers, and mistakes have got to improve. 4.) We have to learn from the last 2 games, put them behind us, and realize it's a new season starting in 2 weeks against Central.  The way I look at it, where the Spartans go from here will be the ultimate test of character and heart and I am looking forward to seeing how they respond.

Wait, they'll measure. And they got it.   Thought the Johnnies had a great shot. Didn't listen to the first half but sounded a big turn was when Johnnies were up 14-7, with the ball in Tommie territory but didn't do anything and then trailed by half by 8. Rushing game was nonexistent today.   Hopefully they can run the table but obviously several tough games to go, starting next week.

They also had two missed FG's so they were in this the whole game. Maybe they're a 2012 sleeper, maybe they caught UWW sleeping, maybe a little of both.

Wartburg actually moving the ball a bit, but can't nothing going once they get within the 30.  Really bad roughing the passer call against Bethel. Just a great hit on the QB as he threw on 3rd and 8. 1st down, but Mathis, the LB who got the PF, bounced back with an INT a couple plays later.  Physical game so far, no ones really established much so far in the run game. Wartburg's had a couple of nice passes down field. \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: DadofBashWarrior.. on August 05, 2012, 04:12:19 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Best of luck to the Greenville College Panthers this year as they open camp later this week...[  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n How's it looking?  They're picked as a pretty strong favorite to win the UMAC.  EC is looking good, according the talk, but I'm a little worried about us offensively.  Going to be tough to make up for losing Schmidgall and Hess, and while I like Dawson, he's not a power back.  However, our defense will be very tough up front, secondary is always a question.  That said, I think we can finally finish with a winning record if the chips fall right.  This conference is always wide open--that's what makes it a good fit for us despite the travel. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Pat Coleman on September 02, 2012, 12:39:53 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: ecreddevils on September 01, 2012, 08:29:31 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Sam Durley of Eureka College broke the ALL TIME single game passing record today with 736 yards in a 62-55 comeback win over Knox College!!  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n And D3football.com was there.    \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Excellent Pat!

Good stuff. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n  To fans of D-3 football everywhere .  I am honored to have been asked to spread the word regarding a new cancer fund that has been established to help Tom Pattison, UW-W sports broadcaster and founder of  www.warhawkfootball.com     I and my family know, all to well, how a cancer diagnosis can be devastating to a families daily lives and finances. Please, consider making even the smallest donation to Tom.   The following is an open letter by Retired UW-W Coach Bob Berezowitz:   Team Tom Cancer Fund Drive established   Once a Warhawk, always a Warhawk are the often spoken words by Tom Pattison, longtime voice of the Warhawks. Over the many years of broadcasting UW-Whitewater football, basketball and baseball games on KOOL 106.5 (and prior to that (940 WFAW), Tom has bled purple during each one of his broadcasts.  Unfortunately, on May 28, 2012 Tom was diagnosed with advanced stage 2 colon cancer. He underwent colorectal cancer surgery in Fort Atkinson and in the process has developed astronomical hospital and medical bills.  Tom has already gone through the first phase of radiation treatment at the UW Cancer Clinic along with chemotherapy with phase two starting later this month.  Tom has given his heart and soul to Warhawk athletics over his 25 years of living here in southern Wisconsin. He served six years as the president of the UW-Whitewater Quarterback Club and still serves on the clubs board of directors.  In 2003 Tom founded Warhawkfootball.com where Warhawk fans, players, former players and parents have been able to view up-to-date Warhawk football news and information 365 days a year. Nearly 1.5 million visitors have clicked onto the Website over the years.  The Website that has been funded entirely by Tom has been a popular voice for Warhawk football fans not only locally but around the world.  Well now Tom needs your assistance in his battle with cancer.  With the help and leadership of UW-Whitewater Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Dr. Paul Plinke and former Warhawk football coach Bob Berezowitz and KOOL 106.5 Radio a team has been set up to lead a campaign to raise funds for Tom.   The \"Team Tom Cancer Fund\" has been established through Commercial Bank in Whitewater and is now accepting donations.  Donations may be sent to: Team Tom Cancer Fund, c/o Commercial Bank, 200 South Freemont St. Whitewater, WI 53190   The fund raising drive will also include Tom Pattison Day at Perkins Stadium on Oct. 6, 2012. More details will be announced shortly.  I have known Tom for many years while coaching and now in retirement, Berezowitz said. There is not another person who has given more of himself to help promote UW-Whitewater football. He is always writing articles for both past and present players that are published on his Website.  It is now our turn to say thank you for his efforts by considering making a donation to the to assist Tom in his time of need.

I'm just not sure they beat anyone as good as Mount was in 2003. That SJU team was loaded on D and had the all-time gamer at QB in Keating. That MUC team was supposed to have been there greatest ever going into the game and no one was even giving SJU a chance. I think that 2003 Mount team beats this years Mount team handily. So I'll give the nod to SJU 03 over UWW '11, but I'd love to actually see the matchup. And with Elliot under center Linfield was nearly unstoppable in 2004...60ish TD's is just ridiculous.  If we take into consideration the 3-peat, I'd put them at #3. It's remarkable what they've done at UWW this decade. The transition to LL has been flawless and he's got a stranglehold on a very fertile DIII recruiting area (Milwaukee/Chicagoland/Madison). They've got to replace #33 next season, but they just reload at so many positions and this continued postseason success means guys who are SR's have as many as 10-20 extra games under the belt if they are 2+yr starters. That's the kind of experience that has made UMU so good for so long. Those extra games and practices deep into December are invaluable. You give great players that kind of seasoning and it's a lethal combo.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: hazzben on December 22, 2011, 01:18:45 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: BoBo on December 19, 2011, 09:36:37 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: 02 Warhawk on November 03, 2011, 04:06:15 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Here's my ballot  *1. 2009 UWW - Rush, Pass, Defend, Special Teams....this team was the best. *2. 2010 UWW - Beat a Gagliardi trophy winner, won at NCC, at Wesley, and UMU *3. 2004 Linfield - Best DIII QB ever? *4. 2003 SJU - Was there anything Blake Elliot couldn't do? *5. 2007 UWW - Gagliardi Trophy winner and best front seven that program ever had. *6. 1999 PLU - Won it as a 7th seed!!! 7. 2000 SJU - Just a field goal away in the Stagg Bowl 8. 2006 UWW - Same team as 2005, but more experienced 9. 2005 UWW - Beat #1 on the road, Stagg Runner up 10. 2005 Linfield - Would have been Stagg Bowl bound if not for UWW  * Stagg Bowl winners  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Where will the 2011 champion fit in?  With three in a row,  hard not to place it somewhere in the top 3, pushing #10 out of the top 10, IMO.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n I think I'd put this years UWW team at #5 actually, if we consider this solely on the basis of 1 season.   \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n I was thinking #6, that 2007 UWW team beat a REALLY good Mount team in the Stagg Bowl.

Could have been wider. The Generals fumbled a goal line possession with about 2 minutes to go in the half. Centre&#039;s offensive line looks confused. They are definitely struggling against the General&#039;s offense. Similarly, Centre has had at least 2 good drives showcasing their offense and, when they pass, look very tough to stop. They seem to want to run, which isn&#039;t working all that well.<br /><br />The Generals will kick off to lead the second half, but Centre has some work cut out for them, especially proving they can stop the General&#039;s offense to catch up. Looks similar to last year where Centre made the second half adjustments to come back and win, but can they do the same on the road and without the bye week to prepare?</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"moderatorbar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"smalltext floatleft\" id=\"modified_1441733\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"smalltext largepadding floatright\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/ip.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLogged\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"bordercolor\">\n\t\t\t<a id=\"msg1441762\"></a>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clearfix topborder windowbg largepadding\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"floatleft poster\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4><a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?action=profile;u=31519\" title=\"View the profile of jknezek\">jknezek</a></h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"reset smalltext\" id=\"msg_1441762_extra_info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Starter</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" /><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" /><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" /></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"margintop\">Karma: 71</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/useroff.gif\" alt=\"Offline\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin-top: 2px;\" /><span class=\"smalltext\"> Offline</span></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Posts: 500</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"margintop\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"reset nolist\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?action=profile;u=31519\"><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/icons/profile_sm.gif\" alt=\"View Profile\" title=\"View Profile\" border=\"0\" /></a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postarea\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"flow_hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"keyinfo\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageicon\"><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/post/xx.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 id=\"subject_1441762\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?topic=4747.msg1441762#msg1441762\" rel=\"nofollow\">Re: Old Dominion Athletic Conference</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"smalltext\">&#171; <strong>Reply #15138 on:</strong> <strong>Yesterday</strong> at 08:52:15 pm &#187;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"msg_1441762_quick_mod\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"post\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"hrcolor\" width=\"100%\" size=\"1\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inner\" id=\"msg_1441762\">W&amp;L up 27-10 at end of the third.

Offensively they can move the ball, but they can&#039;t score. Very few penalties. W&amp;L has put the football on the ground 4 times but lost only 1. W&amp;L is, so far, just winning this game outright.</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"moderatorbar\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"smalltext floatleft\" id=\"modified_1441768\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"smalltext largepadding floatright\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/ip.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLogged\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"bordercolor\">\n\t\t\t<a id=\"msg1441775\"></a>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clearfix topborder windowbg largepadding\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"floatleft poster\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4><a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?action=profile;u=31519\" title=\"View the profile of jknezek\">jknezek</a></h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"reset smalltext\" id=\"msg_1441775_extra_info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Starter</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" /><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" /><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/star.gif\" alt=\"*\" /></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"margintop\">Karma: 71</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/useroff.gif\" alt=\"Offline\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin-top: 2px;\" /><span class=\"smalltext\"> Offline</span></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Posts: 500</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"margintop\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"reset nolist\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?action=profile;u=31519\"><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/icons/profile_sm.gif\" alt=\"View Profile\" title=\"View Profile\" border=\"0\" /></a></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"postarea\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"flow_hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"keyinfo\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"messageicon\"><img src=\"http://www.d3boards.com/Themes/core/images/post/xx.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 id=\"subject_1441775\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?topic=4747.msg1441775#msg1441775\" rel=\"nofollow\">Re: Old Dominion Athletic Conference</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"smalltext\">&#171; <strong>Reply #15140 on:</strong> <strong>Yesterday</strong> at 09:14:59 pm &#187;</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"msg_1441775_quick_mod\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"post\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"hrcolor\" width=\"100%\" size=\"1\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"inner\" id=\"msg_1441775\">Centre has a long drive for a TD but is creamed on the 2pt conversion. 34-16 with 6 minutes to go in the game.

ODAC 1-1 so far in what I consider underdog games this weekend. Catholic got creamed, but I thought this might be a chance for Guilford to get on the board. Hopefully they can build on this entering the conference schedule. W&L has to get a win tonight at home. R-MC and E&H both won as expected. I would say the ODACs overall weekend depends on the Generals.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nThanks.  I know the Generals have Centre tonight - good luck! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Generals up 21-10 at the end of the first half. Could have been wider. The Generals fumbled a goal line possession with about 2 minutes to go in the half. Centre's offensive line looks confused. They are definitely struggling against the General's offense. Similarly, Centre has had at least 2 good drives showcasing their offense and, when they pass, look very tough to stop. They seem to want to run, which isn't working all that well.  The Generals will kick off to lead the second half, but Centre has some work cut out for them, especially proving they can stop the General's offense to catch up. Looks similar to last year where Centre made the second half adjustments to come back and win, but can they do the same on the road and without the bye week to prepare? \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n W&L up 27-10 at end of the third. After 103 straight PATs, W&L finally missed one. Colonels have the ball but 4th and 9 on Generals 27. Generals stop the Colonels on first play of 4th to take over the ball.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n W&L looking back to their best of the last 2 years. Pass defense is better, offense is much better with some passing mixed in very effective. W&L up 34 - 10 with 9:30 to go in the 4th. Centre is definitely on their back foot. Offensively they can move the ball, but they can't score. Very few penalties. W&L has put the football on the ground 4 times but lost only 1. W&L is, so far, just winning this game outright. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Centre has a long drive for a TD but is creamed on the 2pt conversion. 34-16 with 6 minutes to go in the game. W&L made them take 14 plays to get there.   Centre recovers the onside kick. The kicker actually hit 2 very good onside kicks, the first was waved off for penalties. Very odd to see two kicks take Centre bounces. Either crazy good skill, or crazy good luck.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Garbage time in Lexington has started. W&L up 34-16, with the ball with about 2 and a half to go, Centre out of timeouts. This game went well for W&L with a few problems. W&L has gotten better each of their 3 games. If I was an ODAC opponent, I would not want to go to Lexington. On the road, W&L looked way more vulnerable.  \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Congratulations to teams in the newly formed SAA!  As the new conference begins to sort itself out, we seem to be well represented in the Top 25/TRV.  Will look forward to seeing these young teams develop through the season. I come from a \"mixed\" family - graduates from Millsaps, Rhodes, and BSC (with one unfortunate graduate from Ole Miss' nursing school, though she redeemed herself with a Masters from Emory).  We may even cover another school with one last chance - perhaps one of our new entering SAA schools like Berry. So it's always fun at my house! Good luck to everyone this year! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Ron Boerger on September 10, 2012, 10:04:46 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: PrayingColonel on September 09, 2012, 09:56:57 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Centre cracks the top 25 at #23. Congratulations Colonels!  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Well-deserved, too.  Going to be some interesting games down the stretch between Centre, B-SC, Millsaps, and Trinity, all of whom are playing well and really don't want to have any losses this year since playoff bids are going to be so hard to come by.  Wesley probably has the pool B bid locked up, barring upset, so all those teams will be fighting for a C.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nWesley must beat UMHB this weekend.  If Trinity and Wesley only lose to UMHB, but Trinity has more South Region wins, the criteria might favor Trinity. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Good point, Ralph - but Wesley's SOS is probably going to knock that of the SAA teams out of the park.   Trinity playing what appears to be three teams in the lower half of the ASC won't help them, either (UMHB will, but not enough).  Would 9-1 over 5-1 in-region overcome a substantial SOS deficit?    Centre and B-SC both get Trinity at home this season; 9-1 will be tough, though I'm encouraged by what I've seen from the Tigers so far.   \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Generals up 21-10 at the end of the first half. Could have been wider. The Generals fumbled a goal line possession with about 2 minutes to go in the half. Centre's offensive line looks confused with some of the blitzes W&L has done when they are in passing downs. The Colonels are definitely struggling against the General's offense. Similarly, Centre has had at least 2 good drives showcasing their offense and, when they pass block, look very tough to stop. They seem to want to run, which isn't working all that well.  The Generals will kick off to lead the second half, but Centre has some work cut out for them, especially proving they can stop the General's offense to catch up. Looks similar to last year where Centre made the second half adjustments to come back and win, but can they do the same on the road and without the bye week to prepare? \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Looks like W&L was able to hold off the Centre comeback to win 34-16.  The description in the W&L press release makes it sound like a really entertaining ball game.  Going to make for an interesting time for when B-SC has to play CC here in a few weeks. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n To be honest, it wasn't all that close of a game. Centre could move the ball, as evidenced by the yards, so long as they were outside the Generals 30 yard line. After that, they ran out of options. Centre had 2 really good drives, and winning the onside kick made it slightly more nervy for the Generals than it needed to be, but there wasn't a quarter where the Generals didn't outscore the Colonels and it never looked like the Colonels were going to make a serious run from mid third through the 4th. Last year's game was much more competitive and closer. Centre is going to have to be much better if they are going to challenge B-SC or Trinity.   The QB looks to be the difference to me from last year, which is understandable going from Senior to Soph. He made some good throws, some bad throws (could have been picked twice if W&L held on to the throws), and it looked like for almost the middle half of the game Centre's coaches lost a little faith in him and went to a lot of running plays. When they let him throw short or run off a read, he was pretty effective, but by that time the Generals were already in soft defense (mid-third) so those 6-8 yard passes were open from the 20 to the 30 yard line. After that, the Generals would clamp down and he lost his easy outlets. He does look like a winner as he picks up some experience. Good athleticism and he seemed to do his reads pretty well.  Defensively, Centre had no answer for the Generals. W&L mixed in just enough passes to keep them from putting more than 7 in the box and Centre was completely flummoxed by sweeps. With 7 in the box if the sweep got to the edge they were sealed off. They moved one man back to prevent it, W&L faked the sweep and ran through holes in the middle. Unless they improve, they are not the team I saw last year considering I think W&L is also a weaker version of the last 2 years. Be interesting to see if Sewanee has the same effect on them as the Generals.   Just like last year, I think these two teams are somewhat evenly matched despite vastly different styles and the home team probably wins. Last year there was no doubt in my mind W&L wins that game at home. This year I think Centre probably would have won at home, but it would have been just as tight as last year. \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n As it stands right now I'll be in SA next week to see the Cru and go to Sea World (importance is flipped for my wife but if not for the game there is not trip this week). I am interested in TUs bounce back. Getting shelled by SRSU has to be PTSD inducing. I'm also curious about the UMHB SRSU game in 2 weeks. We'll know then if they've risen up the ASC ladder.  \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Except McMurry had one of the top offenses in the nation and Trinity limited them to 25 points. Trinity is obviously hurting from the loss of Tyler Barrett and Antonio Debouse but other than that they aren't missing too much more. I guess I'm still just in shock. How does a team go from 2-8 to upsetting the #11 Team in the Nation? Did their transfers make that big of a difference? Sul Ross has a stellar offense but I think they will have to step up majorly on defense if they want to come away with another big win at UMHB. \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n mu gets a 34-21 win over gcq...game wasn't really as close as the score...gcq scores twice late after being down 34-7 - the running game for mu racked up 170+ yards and the monarchs only threw it 12 times - ferrum gets the only other usasac win  i saw that w&j was up for most of the game vs. #9 SJF, before losing 28-24...not sure if that means anything for the monarchs, though \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: hoopstermom on September 08, 2012, 07:29:14 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: CNU85 on September 08, 2012, 06:10:11 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n  No way were there 7,000 people there.

CNU fans are really looking forward to this 4 year series. We treated it like a rivalry even though it was first matchup ever. Let me know if you come to CNU next year and I will show you around. I noticed the hsc fans loved the band. Even had one guy give a standing ovation!!!   We brought the band, I noticed the dance team was there but not in uniform, 4 buses of students and less than half the team. We left 77 at home. And thanks to HSC hospitality for the food at the tailgate. It was a great time.   I did hear that one of the buses for the team didn't show and so players started cramming into cars!   Good luck!!! Your QB is going to be hard to beat!!  Watch out llamaguy!!!!! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n CNU85  Didn't know that CNU and HSC have entered into a four year deal. HSC has also entered into an agreement to play Walbash home and away. Two difficult out of conference games but if you're going to get better I guess you need to play better teams. I look forward to visting CNU next year. I hear the atmosphere is really good and I know the game will be a difficult one for HSC to win. Good luck the rest of the season. I didn't see the band As I migrated to my usual spot for halftime but I heard alot of people speak highly of your band.   \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n i'm anxious for the weekend for a number of reasons...not the least of which is finding out more about the monarchs   they've played a good team relatively close (w&j) and they've blown out a bad team (guilford)...i think ehc is closer to w&j than they are to gcq  to beat ehc, i think mu is going to have to be more balanced than they were vs. gcq...12 pass attempts won't get it done  ehc appears to be less effective on the ground than they've been the last few years, averaging just 3.2 ypc and to date, mu has held opponents to just 2.7 ypc - despite giving up a lot of yards late vs. guilford, i like the way the monarch defense is playing...they looked like they were flying to the ball in both games - that aggressive play has led to some drive sustaining penalties in both games, though - mu can't continue to do this...they're averaging over 100 penalty yards/game  the offense needs to find some balance and gain more than the 277 total yards they've gained in each of the first two games  go monarchs! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n If anyone is interested I'm running the USAC Pick-Em's thread again this season.  We're a couple games in already but it's never too late to jump in.   http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?topic=7806.0   Also, I have to agree with both '85s on the attendance of the CNU-HSC game, I would be surprised if it was over 3000.  The only way that 7606 is even remotely possible is if they counted every time someone walked towards the stadium and ended up counting the same people several times as they moved between the tailgate, stadium, restroom, concessions, etc. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Agrred on the comments regarding attendance this past Saturday at the CNU vs. HSC game. The crowd was very small by HSC standards. Don't know why but I assume UVA playing at home and the race in Richmond has something to do with it. Show up for homecoming or the Macon game and you'll see a crowd approaching 10,000 people. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\n\n \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\"  Ephesians 6:12 \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n tough loss for the monarchs, today...leading 20-10 at halftime, they were shut out in the second half and allowed ehc 24 points   reber had a big game through the air, throwing for 295 yards and 2 tds (no int's) on a 22-38 night, and he chipped in 49 rushing yards, to boot  mu held ehc to just 2.6 ypc, but ehc ran it 31 times and threw it 51 times for 364 yards...and mu had 16 penalties for 134 (vs. 5/44 for ehc)...you can't give a quality team that many free yards on the road and expect to win...this young team needs to learn how to play aggressively without drawing flags, and they need to close out games \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Well, congrads to UMHB for a game well played.  They had a great defense with a matching offense.    Wesley's offense was downright anemic in the first half.  The noticeable absence here was Askia Jahad who injured his knee at Salisbury.  He popped up in the second half for a couple plays without touching the ball and that was what Wesley had to show for a power running offense: nada.  You can't finesse runs again UMHB and this forced Wesley into a single dimensional passing scheme that UMHB did a good job covering.  My worst worries came true with Wesley's early season offensive mistakes.  While UMHB was pretty crisp on execution on offense, Wesley still had cobwebs galore.  Poor blocking on the offense resulted in Sottilaire's rushed passes.  Penalties early on curtailed any possible movement down the field.  Wesley's defense did what they could but (not seeing what the possession times were yet) they were on the field forever.  By the second half, at least 3 defensive players were down for cramps.  That said, the defense was solely responsible for Wesley staying in the game until the end.  They gave the offense opportunities to tie or win the game, and the offense just couldn't oblige.   So, while I was disappointed, Wesley did stay in the game.  They were down by 2 TD's in the 4th and yet kept at it.  On to next week and Louisiana College.  I am sure Wesley and UMHB will meet once again in the playoffs and the offense will show up and play by then.  They always do.  -Ski \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n The difference in this game was the UMHB defensive line and the ability of Bailey and Wilson to turn negative plays into positive ones.  Wesley's oline got manhandled all game.  They could not open any holes when Wesley attempted to run and they couldn't give Sottilaire enough time to make plays.  I mentioned earlier in the week that the o-line had to play well and they did not.  Bailey turned 2 plays into Td\"s that could have just as easily been sacks which would have forced UMHB to kick field goals.  Lewis did the same thing on his TD run, hit in the backfield, breaks tackels and scores.  Wesley's d played pretty well but did not make the plays necessary to get off the field in the first half.  I believe UMHB converted all but 1 3rd down in the first half.  How good is Wesley, I guess that depends on how good UMHB is.  Despite being dominated by the d-line and no running game Wesley had the ball at mid field with 5 minutes to play with a chance to tie the game.  I think this will end up being a really good football team especially if the o-line steps up.  The missed extra points are killers in close games and overall the special teams look sloppy.  UMHB will be tough to beat and likely the 1 seed in the south.  With UWW losing the rest after Mount is wide open.  Should Mount stumble then this could be a really interesting season with numerous teams having a chance to win it all, including Wesley as long as they win out. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Congrats to the Cru for a great game and a well deserved win.  The most frustrating thing about the offense for me was that they showed flashes of brilliance (aka one of the early drives in the 1st quarter after a UMHB touchdown, similar to the one at SU last week after a score) where they click and go right down the field, but other times .... uggh.... The o-line got their butts kicked most of the game, receivers dropping  balls they should have caught and not coming back to the ball other times, Sottilare making some questionable throws, missed PAT's, stupid penalties....  I agree with Ski that the defense made a good effort to keep us in the game, but the number of missed tackles was unbelievable.  Great job by UMHB to control the line of scrimmage and get the win.   And yet even with all our problems, we were in it right to the end.  Hopefully we'll have a chance to meet again in the playoffs and win when it really counts.  Looking forward to next week to see how we bounce back.  BIG congrats to Buffalo State for knocking off UWW!!  Sounds like there were several great games today. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n When I think of the Wesley offense early in the season, I think of the term, \"two degrees of separation.\"  They are so close to getting it right, but they aren't there yet.  It becomes like a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde situation.  -Ski \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Howdy to all the Centennial fans!  We have been a little slow to start posting this season.  Would love to hear from all of you with your pickems for this week.  I volunteer to be the pickems administrator this year.  Unless anyone else wants the honor.

Other than football, the conference is well represented in all other sports. The addition of CNU helps in all sports, I know Salisbury and CNU have great rivalry games in baseball, softball, volleyball, and football. I know in the past that Averett played teams in the ACFC freqently. There may be other non-NCAA teams on the horizon, I would still love for Catholic, Galudet, and Stevenson to join. Catholic and Galudet are charter members and Stevenson vs. Salisbury in Lacrosse is always an epic match-up.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFor newbies to this message board...  Catholic left the CAC to form the Landmark Conference, and affiliate with the ODAC for football. Gallaudet left the CAC to join the North East Athletic Conference Stevenson is leaving the CAC for the MAC in all sports.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Yeah, I know. I can still wish.  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Yeah, that sux that Stevenson left right at the wrong time for the CAC to gain some steam for getting Football added to the ticket. However,  I think it is just a matter of time for the CAC to gain football and with that, a home for Wesley Football.   Good news seeing SVU coming on board!  -Ski \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n The one fly in the ointment could be Frostburg St. They dropped Wesley like a hot potato from their schedule as soon as the ACFC commitment was over. So much for the CAC teams playing each other..  If you remember they refused to change there schedule the first season of the  ACFC existence. So I wouldn't be suprised if they held things up again.      Some of the discussion here about the CAC and another conference combining for football may be in the future!  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Nice....A CAC football board. Gotta love it! I can assure evryone that there will be an AQ opportunity for CAC football schools. Trible would not have agreed to move to the CAC without it. And the man makes things happen. It will not take as long as people think. In fact, I bet there is a plan in place and in motion to make it a reality. I'm sure the SVU situation was known when CNU switched. Time for CNU football to take it up a notch. SU and Wesley....every  year....yikes! At least Wesley Dad and I can take turns buying rounds! I got the first round! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Actually, the CAC and Empire 8 could join together for football without affecting any regular season scheduling.  The CAC members could be made associate members of the E8 for football only.  Each conference would be it's own division within the E8 for football, and play a separate schedule.  Then the two division champions play in the conference championship game for the automatic bid. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n It's worth noting, the five football playing members of the CAC (as of July 1), produced three bids to last year's NCAA tournament.  Gallaudet, obviously, won't be joining the CAC for football, and the conference would have no reason to ask them back.  Though the CAC is a better geographic fit, the Bison have found their home in the ECFC.  They would never be competitive in the CAC.  In the ECFC, they can be.... \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: jmccloskey on July 20, 2012, 04:32:44 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n It's worth noting, the five football playing members of the CAC (as of July 1), produced three bids to last year's NCAA tournament.

The main goal for any progam is to be competitive and win. However, I believe there are many other factors in joining a conference. If being competitive was the only reason, you would see many sub-par teams in many conferences trying to join together to form a conference.   \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Penn.

One other point that I think that we need to recognize is the role of the NEAC as a generator of new athletic programs.  Lots of teams have moved thru the NEAC in the last decade.  The NEAC has provided entry to D-III into other conferences that one might think of as \"stronger\".  The constraints of travel budgets will temper some of the enthusiasm for current affiliation agreements (especially if a Salisbury and a Frostburg don't have to travel to upstate NY for 6-8 games every biennium.) \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Here in Bruxelles, Belgium, the weather in warmer than usual. Just had some free time to read this year's Kickoff. I am very impressed with the detail of every team from top to bottom and some of the featured stories. However, speaking of featured stories, was there any write up on the CAC? If so, please tell me where to look, if not, oh well, I guess I'll have to wait until it becomes official.   If the CAC was in existence this year, I think it would contend for the 2nd or 1st best conferene, just my opinion of course. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n  To fans of D-3 football everywhere .  I am honored to have been asked to spread the word regarding a new cancer fund that has been established to help Tom Pattison, UW-W sports broadcaster and founder of  www.warhawkfootball.com     I and my family know, all to well, how a cancer diagnosis can be devastating to a families daily lives and finances.

UofR came to play- they were plain tired of losing. The Fisher offense had best step it up - it is terrible as it stands. This game always is tough, but I didnt see a top ten team out there last eve. Come conference time things will get sorted out. I will say this, based on Thomas Moore, and Wash and Jeff winning the way they have since they battled Fisher, U of R may be better than many thought. All said- 3-0 in OOC games. Ill take it, but look for a dramatic improvement on O!  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n I agree that 3-0 is 3-0. And that all three of Fiaher's opponents have been good teams. But after watching them the last two weeks, I am terrified of more teams than I should be. Hartwick can score, Utica can score, Forget about Salisbury, and Buff State seems to be rather high after beating some team from out West.

Obviously WP isn't U--Dub but some figured them to be decent. Rowan made them look foolish last night. Maybe this Rowan team is quite good?

When you consider that this was on the road, and (respectfully, Bengals) not some team in the national semis, and the 46-game winning streak...I mean, can any other game even compare? \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Outstanding performance from Buff St. They not only beat a good team, but they beat the natonal champs. I went to Alliance a few years ago and watched Montclair get rolled by the Mount. UWW has beaten the Mount and Buff St. did not allow a TD to UWW. All I can say is you guys rule. Fantistic performance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Buffalo State is a buzz. Plane lands at 9 p.m. Students mulling all around the Student Union waiting to greet them! Good for Buff State, Good for E 8 and good for D3 College football, which we all LOVE!  Thanks rams, Pg and Bomber! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n First and foremost:  Congratulations to Buff St.  Outstanding.  I'm thinking Boyes must be an outstanding coach.    This team was a powerhouse during his first tenure only to collapse when he left.  In his second stint, he has brought this team back to prominence in just three short years.  Great win for East football, the E8 and only one year removed from the NJAC.  Takes a little sting out of our first loss of the season.  Cortland dominated although pass defense remains our achilles heal.  I think some of our first team defense might be looking over their shoulders because the boys behind them are making some noise and may be winning some jobs. If our defense steps up, we are going to be ok.  Nice game for QB Rose.  Miles was awesome at RB as would Autera have been til he got his bell rung.  Hope he is ok.  Bronson Green continues to be a beast at goaline with 3 TDs.  While I feel a little better having seen Cortland yesterday, I do realize we played W. Conn.   Rams....7-0 at Morrisville?  This doesn't appear to be the Montclair team of recent memory.   I'm Kinda worried about Rowan and Brockport. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n rams, with yesterday's results does Brockport become the favorite in the NJAC.  I went back and looked at the stats and they put up 500+ yds on Buff St who held UWW to just over 300.  I watched some of the Brock/Buff game and went to another one since Brockport was dominating it and I was not impressed by what I saw from Buff.  After yesterday, maybe Brockport is that good.  Guess we get to see the next 2 weeks when they play Kean and Rowan on the road.  I may head up to the Kean game since I have plans for the following week and can't get to Rowan.  If not I may make the trip to Montclaire when they come there. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n What a difference two weeks can make. Two weeks ago, Dragon fans were ready to hit the panic button.  After hanging 72 yesterday coupled with the Buff State loss not looking so bad, things are looking up for the Dragons. While there is still plenty to work on, I assume the mood around the locker room is a little more upbeat.  \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Ethelred the Unready on September 13, 2012, 09:05:49 am  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: LewDogg11 on September 12, 2012, 01:19:37 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Ethelred the Unready on September 12, 2012, 12:51:51 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: pumkinattack on September 11, 2012, 10:53:14 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n Been a crazy month or so for PA, but wanted to drop a quick note (in between naps around PA Jr's, class of 2034, schedule) for any LLers still left.    Weird and tough start to the season for the league.  As a passionate alum/loyalist of Bart, I can honestly say (as I posted on the E8 board a second ago) that this is definitely the fastest, most talented defense they've had since I've been involved back to call it the mid 90's.  As good as a few of their defenses or individual players have been, I have no doubt about this.  The front 6 (Tyre Coleman, Auriemma, T Johnson, Guarino Hyde, Worthington & Toran) is easily the best overall group I've seen and some of the secondary guys who've played the past two years, but have been pretty unhealthy are all generally healthy (except one guy, DelPeruto) easing my concern about the secondary.  I really believe this defense is top five in the country.  The offense has the potential to go toe to toe and make a lot of big plays, but they've looked like s**t so far.  That and the penalties will be their downfall if one is to occur during the season.  I guess a lot of emotion comes with the talent, but guys, you can't retailiate even if you're getting illegally cut or otherwise cheapshotted (is that a word?) on the reg (not the poster, but an ode to Kenny Powers).  Webb has to get his focus, the talents ridiculous, but he has way too many mental lapses and I know it's enticing to see 10-25 yards of open field but you (Souffrant, amongst others) have to secure the catch before you can get all that YAC.    Obviously I'm hoping the entire league drops bombs on the rest of they're OOC schedule and improve each week (except for the week they play against Bart, of course), but man I really love what Cragg, Yoder and DeWall (whom I've been pretty critical of in terms of his offensive playcalling, but he's a smart, hard working, good dude for sure) has put together this year.    Good luck to everyone this weekend.  I just hope to make it to the end of a 7pm game with a 3 week old ruining my REM cycles at the moment.   \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n +k for a 3 week old and the 20-25 years before you can rest easy  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n 20-25 years?  Jeesh!  What'd your kid go to Cortland?

DVC might be the more talented team on paper but the Warriors were the victors today.  A personal salute to Coach Clark and Wiser for keeping the lads disciplined and focused all day - a true test of leadership.    One other note:  the officials seemed to be intent on being intrusive as there was laundry on the field much of the day.  This win means the MAC is wide open this year - it will be interesting to see how DVC moves forward and what next week will portend for the Warriors who host the other valley school.  Go Warriors!

They can give the rest of the MAC fits and probably will.  As for the Warriors - they seem to be on a roll but there is still a lot of season left and who knows what will happen.  The play of the game was a very late interception where the DB nearly did a complete turn around to end the Dutchmen's chances - it was worthy of ESPN it was that unbelievable.

Yes, all of the aforementioned teams are in the lower rungs of the better East conferences (E8, LL, NJAC).  But over the last few years we'd seen a disturbing trend that the top NEFC and/or ECFC teams couldn't beat ANYONE in those conferences (i.e. last year Norwich lost to St. Lawrence and then swept the ECFC).  Are the E8, LL, and NJAC still better top to bottom?  Of course.  But at least now there's hope that perhaps the NEFC/ECFC champion wouldn't finish dead-last in each of those respective \"power\" conferences.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Yeah totally agreed.  Although you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone who sees a big difference between lower tier LL/NJAC/E8 teams, and mid-upper level NEFC/ECFC teams, at least traditionally.  Salve and Endicott appear to be on the rise, taking the reigns from Curry.  Right now, Salve has the edge because of their scheduling.  But we'll see when they play each other if there's a difference.  It's tough to really take St. Lawrence seriously ever(or WPI or MMA) not because they don't have good athletes, but because they are so inconsistent and all over the place.  They all almost always win a head-scratcher each season, but can't beat anyone else.    Bridgewater over Springfield was a big surprise to me.  But I may have over-estimated how good Springfield would be this year.  Even a 36-2 win over Husson actually feels like they really aren't very good this year.  I have to agree with Yanks that I might be pulling a little for Salve because of their scheduling.  The season is young, and we don't know much yet. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: LewDogg11 on September 10, 2012, 12:46:09 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n   Salve and Endicott appear to be on the rise, taking the reigns from Curry.   \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n I had a chance to watch both Salve and Endicott games on my dual screen, before I took my drive to Salisbury. I was very impress with Endicott's dominance, they appear and only appear to have the talent to take on some of the top teams in the other conferences. However, I believe the lack of OOC scheduling leads me to conclude that it will be tough for them if they make it to the playoffs and win because of the lack of showing against other teams outside of the NEFC. It is easy to dominate a game, when you know your more talented, yet it is hard to go toe to toe against teams with similar or better talent than yourself without the experience, it showed in 2010 in their game against Cortland State. As for Salve, as Lew said, they may be on the rise to take the reigns of that of Curry, because of the OOC scheduling and I applaud them for that. I actually picked them to beat Montclair, they controlled the game on both sides of the ball last weekend and proved they have the moxie. Hopefully in a couple weeks, the Salve v. Endicott game could be the game of the week in the East.   Nevertheless, maybe when the conference actually split, these teams will schedule tougher OOC opponents, when they know it will not affect their playoff hopes, but for right now, Salve is taking the appropriate steps to becoming a top-tier East team.   \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Yanks 99 on September 10, 2012, 12:05:20 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n I will say this...if Salve runs the table in the NEFC (and I really hope that they do), I will absolutely be the first to say that they would be a completely worthy recipient of an automatic bid this year.  Who knows where Union and Montclair State end up finishing...but I give kudos to Salve for not being the \"normal\" NEFC team (looking at you Curry, Endicott, and WNEC) and scheduling only NEFC and ECFC opponents.  If they (Salve) are 10-0 at the end of the year, with non-conference wins over two \"good\" opponents from much stronger leagues (LL and NJAC), than good for them...and they absolutely deserve their bid.

Looked at the Bowdoin roster and they brought in many linemen.  However, their DL FYs tend to be small....even when you expect them to be LB's.  One DL candidate seems better suited for DB.  Wonder if  Bowdoin defensive coach's leaving to go to Hamilton impacted the schools recruiting class. Williams has still not posted ANY 2012 roster info. nescac1 has provided more info than the Williams website.  All these Williams comments are done with a smile....digs from an Amherst admirer of the school.   We are poor cousins! \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Don't necessarily agree, but here's an advocate for the national competitiveness of some NESCAC teams:  \" DoubleDomer  Re: Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference « Reply #15257 on: Today at 07:12:50 pm »     ReplyQuote \". . . the Cal Lu, Oxy, Whittier, Redlands board\"? I see.  Making no predictions for Hamilton, Tufts, Middlebury,Wes, or the Maine contingent, but anybody who thinks Amherst, Williams + Trinity couldn't play successully in most any D3 conference in the country needs to get out of the barn a little more often. Trinity, in particular, has been a formidable team. Maybe not at the level of the purple juggernauts, but certainly with Bethel, Linfield, CLC, North Central.  If there's a knock on those three, it's that they only play 2 really competitive games a year. How is that different than any of the other top teams?   Members of the Cal Lu, Whittier, Oxy, and Redlands board are, I'm sure, uninterested, but comments from members of the Chapman, LaVerne, CMS, and PP board are welcome.\"  \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n Some might accuse your correspondent of living in a barn, but however one characterizes his abode, he has taken leave from it on occasion and in a number of those trips (say, very roughly 1200) has witnessed the playing of football, all in and at its various kinds and levels. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n I think it goes without saying that an 80 man roster of top-tier D-1 players, all under 200 pounds, would kick the heck out of any D-3 program ...   Amh63, this should whet your appetite for Eph tidbits until the full football roster and preview are posted in a few days:   http://www.thetranscript.com/sports/ci_21550533/ephs-are-learning-how-practice   One thing is for certain, after graduating many enormous, physical, very experienced players at LB, DT, OL, QB, and WR, Williams will be significantly smaller, younger, and faster this year than last. Whether that translates into better success remains to be seen ... \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n NESCAC1.....Thanks! Frank.....I get your point with regards to size...but at what cost!  We are talking about the present day NESCAC where everyone plays and recruits under the same limitations/rules.  My size comments are in that context. Each year at homecoming, I get to talk with a classmate that played fullback for Amherst about changes to the game.  He was often a blocking fullback his senior year for a very talented runner \"Santos\" that was bigger than he was and both were under 200 pounds.  We laugh and wonder if he could play in the \"modern era\".  My opinion is that he could.  In the early 60's, when Amherst played Springfield, the Coast Guard, etc. the two way linemen were smaller but still very much over 200 lbs.....but not the size of today's starters. Amherst's starting offensive line should average over 275 lbs! Anyway.....there is a nice review of two \"football\" books out in today's WSJ that may interest the posters.  It talks about West Point football and the last great teams of the late 50's with the Heisman winner Pete Dawkins of the class of 1958...one of my football heroes. It also talks about the decline of the football teams brought on in part by the cheating scandal of '51....the end of an era. Should be interesting reading for followers of today's big time football and even the followers of D3 and the \"CAC\" \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n West Point football was damaged more by Vietnam than the cheating scandal - and has never recovered. And I doubt that the West Point powers-that-be want it to recover. 60s football was a different game from today's football due to rule changes, superior doctoring, superior nutrition, superior training (some of it unethical or, worse yet, illegal), superior equipment, advances in the craft of coaching and superior funding and other resources. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n I was not going to get to this until later today because I was heading to Middletown this AM.  However, since I had not been getting steady communication from my 19 year old son, I asked the wife to text him and make sure he was playing today.  We were approaching Worcester at the time. \"Oh, no.\"  came the reply.  He was not playing for good reasons but with this info, we headed back home so I could write this and work on my golf game.  I asked him to call me later with an appraisal of how things went but his communication skills being what they are........the level of detail may be so so.  Tufts/Bowdoin.  First, I only stayed for the first half.  Second, scores do not matter to me in these scrimmages and I don't even know what it was at the half.  Third, generally speaking, Tufts was a much better team.  Tufts had a bigger team and the whole feel was that they were a more focussed group from Head Coach on down.  At Trinity, I would never attempt to talk to my son during a practice, never mind a scrimmage.  I saw it happen several times by Bowdoin parents and players.  I was on the Bears side where the stands were.  The Tufts side had no seating so no side line observations.  Tufts O-I could not tell some of the QB's playing for Tufts because the red pinnies had no numbers, unlike Bowdoin.  They play almost exclusively from the shotgun as did Bowdoin.  Number 12 (I could make out) John Dodds did play a lot of the first half and he was mobile and quick. Accuracy was rough as you might expect.  #20, Dylan Hass is listed as a WR but seemed to run the ball well.  #87 Marty Finnegan played well at WR.  He moved well and is 6'3\".  But, he impressed me with his punting.  They do have some really tall FY's at WR.  #99 Frank Barba made at least one noticeable catch in the first half.  Tufts D was OK.  Better at DB than line as you might expect.  Both teams had numerous breakups or interceptions.  Always advantage to D.  Especially with many QB's playing.   Bowdoin O-They played #10 and #6 for most of the first half.  Grant White is a tall kid who looked better than Tom Romero although Romero did get better as the half went on.  Both are JR's.  Matt Caputi, coaches son, played at the end of the half.  I think he will play a lot if he is not the starter.  Bowdoin plays from the shotgun.  Probably they need to give the QB another second to live before escaping the rush.  One o-line men that stood out to me was #70 Mike Devin.  He is a soph sited at 6'1\" 273, which may be accurate.  The D was ok.  The DBs again made more of an impression with break ups or ints but the QB's had a lot to do with it.    Bowdoin is small and will struggle this year, I think.  Tufts has made some real progress.  Civetti is doing a good job as far as I can tell.  This is only the first half gunk so the second half could have been all Bears with Caputi going wild, but I doubt it.  \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: Bombers798891 on September 11, 2012, 04:48:03 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Quote from: SJFF82 on September 11, 2012, 04:27:54 pm  \n\n \n\n\n\n clearly Frank you are just playing devil's advocate b/c I dont perceive you have Widener ranked ahead of Fisher in your National Poll?   \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n No way.

I went to the Scrimmage last year and Union out playEd them pretty easily.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n Thanks for posting his name skratch, like dlip said earlier, he was quite impressed with George and feels he has a bright future.   As far as the scrimmage went, at least to dlip, it was much of the same as last year. Union really dominated Castleton in every area of the scrimmage. Union just can't score the way they could last year. With that being said the CS D seemed to hold up better than last year and kept Unions's first team to roughly 21 or 28pts (?). Union has two young QB's and even though dlip thought they looked pretty decent, he thought CS played quite hard and had some good moments in coverage. The CS punter had one very nice punt that was simply beautiful. Also they did a decent job against Union's running game (which is Union's strength) although the Dutchmen's first team did not rush nearly as much as dlip anticipates they will during the season. Honestly for Union, last night was a Sophmore QB audition.  CS defenders had a few very solid hits, they played quite hard. Dlip hopes this offered some insight.  Dlip will be rooting for CS in the ECFC this season and will be keeping an eye on Mr. Basharis the next couple years. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n  To fans of D-3 football everywhere .  I am honored to have been asked to spread the word regarding a new cancer fund that has been established to help Tom Pattison, UW-W sports broadcaster and founder of  www.warhawkfootball.com     I and my family know, all to well, how a cancer diagnosis can be devastating to a families daily lives and finances. Please, consider making even the smallest donation to Tom.   The following is an open letter by Retired UW-W Coach Bob Berezowitz:   Team Tom Cancer Fund Drive established   Once a Warhawk, always a Warhawk are the often spoken words by Tom Pattison, longtime voice of the Warhawks. Over the many years of broadcasting UW-Whitewater football, basketball and baseball games on KOOL 106.5 (and prior to that (940 WFAW), Tom has bled purple during each one of his broadcasts.  Unfortunately, on May 28, 2012 Tom was diagnosed with advanced stage 2 colon cancer. He underwent colorectal cancer surgery in Fort Atkinson and in the process has developed astronomical hospital and medical bills.  Tom has already gone through the first phase of radiation treatment at the UW Cancer Clinic along with chemotherapy with phase two starting later this month.  Tom has given his heart and soul to Warhawk athletics over his 25 years of living here in southern Wisconsin. He served six years as the president of the UW-Whitewater Quarterback Club and still serves on the clubs board of directors.  In 2003 Tom founded Warhawkfootball.com where Warhawk fans, players, former players and parents have been able to view up-to-date Warhawk football news and information 365 days a year. Nearly 1.5 million visitors have clicked onto the Website over the years.  The Website that has been funded entirely by Tom has been a popular voice for Warhawk football fans not only locally but around the world.  Well now Tom needs your assistance in his battle with cancer.  With the help and leadership of UW-Whitewater Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Dr. Paul Plinke and former Warhawk football coach Bob Berezowitz and KOOL 106.5 Radio a team has been set up to lead a campaign to raise funds for Tom.   The \"Team Tom Cancer Fund\" has been established through Commercial Bank in Whitewater and is now accepting donations.  Donations may be sent to: Team Tom Cancer Fund, c/o Commercial Bank, 200 South Freemont St. Whitewater, WI 53190   The fund raising drive will also include Tom Pattison Day at Perkins Stadium on Oct. 6, 2012. More details will be announced shortly.  I have known Tom for many years while coaching and now in retirement, Berezowitz said. There is not another person who has given more of himself to help promote UW-Whitewater football. He is always writing articles for both past and present players that are published on his Website.  It is now our turn to say thank you for his efforts by considering making a donation to the to assist Tom in his time of need.

Obviously they are not world beaters and would not do all that well playing in the E8, NJAC, LL, or MAC. However their gradual improvement and success in their conference is worth recognizing a bit. The ECFC is a very weak conference and not really deserving (outside the rules) of an automatic bid. Yet the truth is, it seems as if some of these teams from traditionally awful conferences are making some progress and getting a tad closer to some of the big boys. dip for one can say he will not be the one to downplay or ignore the success of any team in our region. Obviously if Charles is ridiculous or some make claims for example that because of a 2-0 record Norwich should be in the same conversation with the top teams in the east, dlip will let them know. Congrats to these teams that are showing some imporvement and growth. Let your playing, over time, do the talking for you and you'll be O.K. dlip knows as a Union fan he would surely take a win over SLU at this point. \n\n\n\n.  \t\t\t\t\tLogin with username, password and session length\n\n","description":"<div class=\"quoteheader\"><div class=\"topslice_quote\"><a href=\"http://www.d3boards.com/index.php?topic=4718.msg1441975#msg1441975\">Quote from: fisheralum91 on <strong>Today</strong> at 08:53:12 am</a></div></div><blockquote class=\"bbc_standard_quote\">My 2 cents on the Courage Bowl.<br />UofR came to play- they were plain tired of losing.<br />The Fisher offense had best step it up -
