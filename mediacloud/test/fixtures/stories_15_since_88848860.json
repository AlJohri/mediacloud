the first time in more than three years. \n\n         \n\n The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said the average first-time deposit fell in July to 19%, the lowest level since November 2008. \n\n         \n\n Meanwhile, mortgage lending to all home buyers picked up in July, albeit at still subdued levels. \n\n         \n\n The number of mortgages arranged by lenders rose by 5% from June to 49,500,

had an excellent set of legal powers to tackle their banks if they think they have been treated unfairly. \n\n         \n\n Unfortunately, hardly anyone knows about them, and the relevant authorities have failed to give the powers any meaningful publicity. \n\n         \n\n The rules were been laid down by the  Financial Services Authority (FSA) . \n\n         \n\n They are known as the  Banking: Conduct of Business sourcebook (BCOBS)  and they apply to small businesses as well as to private individuals.  \n\n         \n\n Most significantly, they give any aggrieved customer the right to sue their bank in the county court. \n\n         \n\n This may not obvious to the first-time reader, but it is spelt out right at the bottom of the document  in Schedule 5 . \n\n         \n\n This explicitly links breaches of these rules to the right of individuals to take legal action under section 150 of  Financial Services and Markets Act . \n\n \t      \n\n Under BCOBS, your bank has a duty to operate your current account so the consequences are not unfair to you.   \n\n         \n\n Your bank cannot just go ahead and apply your contractual terms regardless of the consequences.   \n\n         \n\n It is obliged to have regards to your interests, when making decisions.   \n\n         \n\n Your bank may want to say they are only obliged to treat you fairly within the limits of the account contract.   \n\n         \n\n However, fair treatment under BCOBS means you are entitled to receive fair treatment despite the limits of the contract (otherwise BCOBS would be rendered completely ineffective by the bank's terms and conditions). \n\n         \n\n If you discuss your bank's treatment of you calmly with a group of friends or colleagues and the general feeling is you have been treated unfairly, then the chances are you have been. \n\n         \n\n Unfairness depends on the circumstances.   \n\n         \n\n British judges have been deciding what is reasonable or unfair for hundreds of years so it does not pose much of a problem for them. \n\n \t      \n\n Here are a few common examples of treatment likely to be unfair, although none of these have been tested in court yet.  \n\n\n\n     \n\n  Your bank's computer systems suffer a glitch that means certain bills such as gas or loan repayments are not paid automatically or a house purchase cannot be completed.  As a result you incur charges from other companies, or your credit file is marked by other companies. Your bank refuses to take steps to remedy this damage or to compensate you for the time and inconvenience and stress incurred sorting out the mess. \n\n\n\n     \n\n  You are suffering hardship and you enter into an agreement to repay a debt in regular instalments.  Although you never miss a payment and your difficult circumstances haven't changed, your bank for no reason suddenly insists on a higher rate of instalment or complete repayment of the debt. Your bank's demand is likely to plunge you into greater difficulty because either you cannot afford to comply or else if you do, you will be unable to keep up payments to other creditors who have accepted similar repayment schemes. \n\n\n\n       \n\n The simplest way for an ordinary individual to bring an action based on BCOBS is to allege that the BCOBS requirements form part of your current account contract (which they do) and that by breaching BCOBS, your bank has committed a breach of contract (which it has). \n\n         \n\n Keep your claim for compensation modest.   \n\n         \n\n The key is to obtain a judgement in which the judge agrees your bank has breached its statutory duty.   \n\n         \n\n A modest claim, say for £100 or £200, will mean that you risk a much smaller claims fee if you lose. \n\n         \n\n A county court judgement on the basis of a BCOBS breach can have serious consequences for your bank.   \n\n         \n\n If you win, your next step would be to send a copy of the court judgement to the Office of Fair Trading and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) as part of a formal complaint.   \n\n         \n\n The FSA has the power to impose very serious sanctions on the banks if they breach the BCOBS rules. \n\n         \n\n Your bank would be very anxious for this not to happen, but this is the only way to start encouraging good behaviour from your bank. \n\n \t      \n\n It is hardly surprising that the British Banking Association's guide to BCOBS makes no mention whatsoever of this powerful consumer right. \n\n         \n\n Rather more surprising is that the FSA's own Know Your Rights guide makes no mention either. \n\n         \n\n The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) website only makes passing references to BCOBS.   \n\n         \n\n Under the previous Banking Code, it was the FOS which dealt with breaches of it. \n\n         \n\n I am doubtful about the ability of the FOS to apply the new rules. \n\n         \n\n According to the FOS, it seeks to achieve outcomes that are fair to both sides.   \n\n         \n\n But BCOBS is much more one sided - in favour of customers - and requires fair treatment of bank customers in order to offset the inherent inequality in your bargaining-power. \n\n         \n\n As the FOS objectives do not seem to square very well with those laid out in BCOBS, I suggest you take the legal route in the county courts if you have a legitimate complaint about unfair treatment by your bank. \n\n         \n\n  The opinions expressed are those of the author and are not held by the BBC unless specifically stated.

(Reuters) - Australian scientists have developed a genetic test to predict autism spectrum disorder in children, which could provide a long-sought way for early detection and intervention, according to a study published on Wednesday. \n\n    \n\n About one in 150 children has autism, with symptoms ranging from social awkwardness and narrow interests to severe communication and intellectual disabilities, said researchers led by the University of Melbourne. \n\n  \n\n The researchers used U.S. data from more than 3,000 individuals with autism in their study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, to identify 237 genetic markers in 146 genes and related cellular pathways. \n\n  \n\n By measuring these markers, which either contribute to or protect an individual from

But some scientists argue this is an illusion, caused by the relative movement of Earth in relation to the rest of the cosmos. Others suggest shortcomings in our understanding of gravity are more likely responsible than dark energy. \n\n  \n\n \"Dark energy is one of the great scientific mysteries of our time, so it isn't surprising that so many researchers question its existence,\" said Bob Nichol, a member of the Portsmouth team involved in the research, which was published in the academic journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \n\n  \n\n \"But with our new work, we're more confident than ever that this exotic component of the universe is real - even if we still have no idea what it consists of.\" \n\n  \n\n A basic premise of modern cosmology is that the visible universe of stars, planets and gases makes up about 4 percent of the cosmos and is sitting like flotsam in a massive sea of unknown material referred to as dark energy. Dark energy is thought to make up 73 percent of the cosmos, while the slightly less mysterious dark matter comprises the remaining 23 percent. \n\n  \n\n One of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark energy is in the so-called Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect. \n\n  \n\n In 1967, Rainer Sachs and Arthur Wolfe theorized that light from the radiation from the heat left over from the Big Bang, would become slightly more blue as it passed through the gravitational fields of lumps of matter in the universe, an effect known as gravitational redshift. \n\n  \n\n The existence of dark energy would cause light from this residual radiation to gain energy as it travels through large lumps of mass. \n\n  \n\n In 1996, astronomers Robert Crittenden and Neil Turok suggested overlaying a map of the local universe on the picture of the residual cosmic radiation could provide clues about where to look for the effect. In 2003, it was spotted, albeit weakly. \n\n  \n\n It was seen as supporting evidence for dark energy and hailed as the 'Discovery of the Year' in Science magazine. \n\n  \n\n But some scientists argued it could have been caused by cosmic dust and questioned the discovery. \n\n  \n\n The Anglo-German team that carried out the latest study was led by Crittenden and Tommaso Giannantonio. They re-examined all the arguments against the detection and have improved the maps used in the original work. \n\n  \n\n They conclude that dark energy is almost certainly responsible for the hotter parts of the cosmic microwave background. \n\n  \n\n \"We have methodically addressed all of these issues and concluded none of them can explain the observations we see,\" Nichol told Reuters. \"In the end, the only remaining explanation is dark energy - if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.\" \n\n  \n\n Radio telescopes like the huge Square Kilometre Array that will be sited in remote areas in South Africa and Australia, should improve the tricky process of measuring distances in the universe and give more definitive data, he said. \n\n  \n\n \"What dark energy could be, theoretically, is another question,\" Nichol said. \n\n  \n\n (Editing by Stacey Joyce) \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Thomson Reuters  is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing  investing news ,  world news ,  business news ,  technology news , headline news,  small business news , news alerts,  personal finance ,  stock market , and  mutual funds information  available on Reuters.com,  video ,  mobile , and interactive television platforms.

So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge. And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less.” \n\n  \n\n\n\n Readers may recall that in July  we gave Four Pinocchios  to Mitt Romney for a television advertisement accusing President Obama of gutting Bill Clinton’s welfare overhaul — and  also Three Pinocchios  for the Obama administration’s counterspin that Romney himself had sought a similar waiver when he was governor of Massachusetts. \n\n\n\n What’s the fuss about? Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the centerpiece of the 1996 legislation, established work requirements and time-limited benefits for recipients. But in July the Department of Health and Human Services issued  a memorandum  saying that it was encouraging “states to consider new, more effective ways to meet the goals of TANF, particularly helping parents successfully prepare for, find, and retain employment.” As part of that, the HHS secretary would consider issuing waivers to states concerning worker participation targets. \n\n\n\n HHS’s action set off a firestorm of criticism by Republicans, which was echoed in Romney’s ad.  \n\n\n\n In his high-profile speech at the Democratic convention, Clinton himself came to Obama’s defense, claiming that the change in rules actually would require “more work, not less.” Last week, we said we wanted to spend some time digging into this statement before making a ruling. After talking to many people on all sides of the welfare debate, we can certainly say it is a very complex issue — which makes it ripe for fact-checking.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n The Facts \n\n  \n\n\n\n There are three basic rules in Washington: 1) Nothing happens by accident, 2) Personnel determines policy, and 3) No argument is ever settled. That dynamic is central to understanding the controversy surrounding the HHS memo. In this case, conservatives suspected that the administration was trying to achieve through regulatory fiat what liberals had not been able to accomplish through legislation in the past 16 years. \n\n  \n\n By many accounts, a key player in the development of the memo was  Mark Greenberg , the deputy assistant secretary for policy at HHS’s Administration for Children and Families, which oversees TANF. Key aspects of the memo — which was signed by Earl S. Johnson, director of the Office of Family Assistance — turn up in  testimony before Congress  that Greenberg gave over the years when he was outside of government, arguing for changes in the 1996 law.  \n\n\n\n On the opposite side of the long-running debate is  Robert Rector , a Heritage Foundation scholar who helped craft the law. (Here’s an example of the  two men testifying side by side before Congress , as the yin and yang of the welfare reform debate.)  \n\n\n\n As soon as the HHS memo was issued, Rector raised  the clarion call     that Obama, through stealth, was gutting the law because, he says, he recognized that ideas — what he labels “loopholes” — that Democrats had been unable to slip into legislation had suddenly been offered to states in the form of waivers. \n\n\n\n Boiled down, one key difference between the two sides is whether one should focus on job search (conservative) or job training (liberal). There was little job training in the 1996 law, which put the main focus on getting people back to work.  \n\n\n\n The HHS memo listed as possible projects for waivers such ideas as “multi-year career pathways models for TANF recipients that combine learning and work.”  \n\n\n\n Another issue is whether provisions should be made for people who are disabled. Indeed, the HHS memo touts “projects that demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities, along with an alternative approach to measuring participation and outcomes for individuals with disabilities.”  \n\n\n\n Critics suggest that opens the door for a whole class of people being removed from needing to find work, making it easy to boost published employment rates for others receiving assistance. In other words, if a pool of 100,000 people is reduced by 10,000, then the percentage of people finding work will increase even if the number who are employed remains the same. \n\n\n\n We had earlier said that the HHS memo certainly appeared to be a process foul, a position  recently supported  by the Government Accountability Office. (The Congressional Research Service offered a different point of view, in  a report  released this week by Democrats.)  \n\n\n\n The Romney welfare ad took an extreme interpretation of the memo, claiming that Obama has already taken action to “drop work requirements.” The ad further states that “under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and you wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check.”  \n\n\n\n That’s not apparent in the memo — at least not yet, since no waivers have been granted. But interestingly the claim made by Clinton — that the “administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent” — is not in the memo either.  \n\n\n\n Instead, that assertion appears in  a letter  written by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) after Republicans erupted at HHS’s issuance of the memo. She wrote: \n\n\n\n “Specifically, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the state’s past performance. States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect. If they fail, their waiver will be rescinded.” \n\n\n\n The original HHS memo makes no mention of such requirements. Indeed, it is significantly weaker. The memo does not cite a one year time limit to demonstrate progress, for instance. \n\n\n\n Instead, the memo suggests that states have at least several opportunities to prove that their plan works: “States that fail to meet interim targets will be required to develop improvement plans. Repeated failure to meet performance benchmarks may lead to the termination of the waiver demonstration pilot.” \n\n\n\n In an interview, administration officials said that this is an “iterative process” and Sebelius’ letter represented the most up-to-date version of administration policy. Still, there seems to be some wiggle room, as there is no definition yet of “clear progress.”  \n\n\n\n “The states have to show they are making progress within a year,” one senior official said. “They need to identify interim targets year after year” if they are not meeting the 20 percent threshold. The original memo also said that “absent special circumstances, the length of an approved project will not exceed five years.” \n\n\n\n How many people are we talking about? The latest data ( Table 46 ) shows that in 2010, of the 1.84 million families on welfare, 16.6 percent — or about 300,000 — left the rolls because of a new job.  \n\n\n\n Looking at the states with Republican governors that the administration said requested waivers, the numbers needed to meet the 20-percent target do not appear to be large. In Nevada, with 0.2 percent (230 families) out 11,520 families getting a job, the target for 20 percent would be an additional 46 families. In Utah, which moved 9.8 percent (735 families) of its 7,496 families to work, the number would be 147 families.  \n\n\n\n The letters from  Nevada  and  Utah  requesting a waiver — which mostly concerned relief from burdensome federal reporting requirements — were sent by the heads of welfare agencies — not by the governors, as Clinton said. The other states that the administration said sought waivers were California, Minnesota and Connecticut, which in theory would need to boost employment by 20,000, 1,573 and 202, respectively.  \n\n\n\n Some critics of the administration’s approach believe it marks a return to simple “employment exit” statistics that marred the early days of state welfare reform efforts. (Under the updated version of the 1996 law, states must meet “a participation rate” in which at least 50 percent of recipients, before credits, participate in defined work activities.)  \n\n\n\n In other words, officials would tout that 15 percent of recipients had left the rolls, without acknowledging that the overall welfare population had grown by 20 percent. One former top welfare official said he could easily meet the administration’s requirements by more assiduously tracking people who found jobs but did not inform the welfare agency.  \n\n\n\n Administration officials insist that will not be the case. For instance, officials said they plan to adjust the targets according to the growth of the economy, so a state could not simply meet its goal because a booming economy has made more jobs available.  \n\n\n\n The administration also says it will not rely on state-supplied data to measure progress. \n\n\n\n “We would not use self-reported data for measuring progress under the waiver,” the official said. “Rather, we would match data on individuals leaving TANF to reliable employment data from the  National Directory of New Hires  (NDNH) and the unemployment system, which tracks earnings. We would do this both prospectively and retrospectively — the latter so that we get a corrected baseline that is accurate.”  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n The Pinocchio Test \n\n  \n\n\n\n Because welfare funding for the states is delivered as a fixed block grant, there is relatively little incentive for a state to increase its welfare rolls. So even critics of the administration’s approach do not imagine the changes will result in significantly more people on welfare. We stand by our earlier ruling on Romney’s welfare ad.  \n\n\n\n Still, there is enough uncertainty about how the administration will implement these waivers that it is a stretch for Clinton to declare for certain that a 20 percent threshold must be met — and to claim that more people will end up working under this new system.  \n\n\n\n The administration’s emerging criteria, which has not been previously reported, certainly sounds reassuring. But, as with everything in Washington, much will depend on how the baseline number is determined — and then how the process is monitored. In theory, a state could go five years without ever meeting the 20 percent threshold.  \n\n\n\n The administration, in fact, only revealed the 20-percent figure once it was under fire. Twenty percent sounds like a lot, but there may be less to that number than meets the eye. Given the long history of the two sides  battling over the implementation of the 1996 law, critics certainly have a right to be wary about why the administration acted in the way it did.  \n\n\n\n We wavered on the number of  Pinocchios in this instance. But we finally settled on two, mainly because Clinton, in his facile way, made this intense debate appear as if it is mainly a dispute about moving “folks from welfare to work.” It is not quite so simple as that, and neither is it clear yet that the net result is that more people on welfare will end up working.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n Two Pinocchios \n\n\n\n Understanding the battle over the looming defense cuts\n\n","description":"\n<p/>\n<p>\n<em>“When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it’s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today.

Shell. \n\n\n\n  Under the terms of the CleanPowerSF program now before the  Board of Supervisors , the city would contract with Shell Energy North America - a subsidiary of Shell Oil - to provide households and businesses with 100 percent renewable electricity. \n\n\n\n The original idea was simple enough: Buy five years of clean energy on the open market and resell it to locals who want to go green. \n\n\n\n The politics were equally attractive: Break the stranglehold that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has long had on consumers, while encouraging the growth of local green alternatives like wind and solar power. \n\n\n\n But the final product isn't what everyone expected. \n\n\n\n For starters, Shell Energy - whose parent company just started drilling for Arctic oil off the coast of Alaska - wound up winning the contract. \n\n\n\n  \"Unfortunately, as much as we've tried, Shell was the only company that was responsive to the city's bid process,\" said Supervisor   David Campos  , who has taken up the green energy cause at the board. \n\n\n\n Having Shell as the city's green alternative is just one of the potential troubles the five-year, $19.5 million deal is encountering. \n\n\n\n The initial sales pitch also included the idea that the program could beat PG&E prices. Instead, both the city controller and budget analyst have concluded that it could actually cost the average household nearly 23 percent extra. \n\n\n\n What's more, PG&E has just filed papers with the state  Public Utilities Commission  announcing its intention to start offering its own 100 percent green energy program in competition with Shell, and probably at a cheaper rate. \n\n\n\n  If San Francisco's program can't compete or goes sideways, the city would be on the hook for Shell's losses, which could total $15 million or more, says the budget analyst.  \n\n\n\n According to city fiscal experts, about 90,000 ratepayers - or about a quarter of the city's residential customers - will need to sign up for the green program to break even. \n\n\n\n  Mayor  Ed   Lee  has begun to express concerns over the risks and costs, including a provision that would automatically enroll San Francisco ratepayers - meaning that anyone who didn't want to participate would have to request to opt out within 60 days. \n\n\n\n \"He looks forward to a robust discussion at the board on this,\" said   Christine Falvey  , the mayor's press secretary. \n\n\n\n Proponents counter that it is worth the gamble. They say going green may not be easy out of the gate, but that in the long run it will pay off. \n\n\n\n \"The hope is once we bring in enough revenue through the program, we can build it out to generate our own wind and solar energy and we don't have to do business\" with companies such as Shell, Campos said. \n\n\n\n  Mayor Raider : Oakland Mayor   Jean Quan   boldly waded into the heart of the Raider Nation on Monday night with a 90-minute trip through the Coliseum parking lot before the game - ending up at the infamous Black Hole tailgating party with the Skeleton and Pirate Dog. \n\n\n\n \"Overall, it went really well,\" said   Chris Dobbins   ,  an  Oakland school board  and Coliseum board member who was there. \n\n\n\n Quan isn't the first Oakland mayor to venture into the nation. We vividly recall   Jerry Brown   sitting in a luxury box, amazed as fights broke out in the stands. \n\n\n\n None of that this time out - just lots of thumbs-up calls to \"build a new stadium,\" and repeated offers of a cold one. \n\n\n\n Quan even stayed for the game, where she was joined by Councilwoman   Desley Brooks .  \n\n\n\n  Smoking hot:  Gilroy's acting fire chief,   Roger Bloom ,  resigned this week after being nabbed in a Santa Cruz County sheriff's sting Friday night for allegedly agreeing to buy alcohol for a minor at a liquor store. \n\n\n\n  Bad enough - but all the more embarrassing, given that the teenage daughter of a former Gilroy firefighter died three years ago of alcohol poisoning at a slumber party held at the home of an ex-City Council member. \n\n\n\n   In the mail:  Attention tech junkies: an insider at FedEx - which is handling Apple's rollout of the iPhone 5 - tells us all employee vacations have been canceled for Sept. 21, 22 and 24 because of an anticipated \"high volume\" of business on those days. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  San Francisco Chronicle  columnists  Phillip Matier  and  Andrew Ross  appear Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays.

The warmth of wood floors makes them a coveted design feature, and people who have wood floors work hard at keeping them looking good. \n\n\n\n Often when people move or make decorating changes in their interiors, or when floors get really dull and worn, they arrange for professionals to sand them to remove old finishes and then apply new ones. \n\n\n\n Installing wood floors, whether of new wood or reclaimed planks or antique wood, is a popular upgrade to houses, especially in living rooms, dining rooms and kitchens, as it's known to increase the resale value. \n\n                                         \n\n For centuries, most wood floors were given a wax finish, which requires regular maintenance and waxing as part of routine housekeeping. Some homes still continue that tradition. But for the past 50 years, the vast majority of wood floors in American homes have been topped with layers of polyurethane. The advantage of this is a nice, durable finish and the ease of maintenance mostly by simple vacuuming and dry mopping. \n\n\n\n One alternative to solid hardwood floors is engineered hardwood, which is made with a top layer of hardwood and a core of crisscrossed layers of other woods. Engineered wood floors are known to be very stable, so they are a popular choice for areas with concrete subfloors or in basements. \n\n\n\n The best feature of wood floors: They go with everything. \n\n\n\n  What's New?  \n\n\n\n Eco-friendly products. More environmentally friendly finishes, such as water-based polyurethane coatings, have lower VOCs (potentially harmful Volatile Organic Compounds) than traditional oil-based products. \n\n\n\n Faster-drying finishes. Manufacturers are developing new technologies that use ultraviolet light to cure polyurethane finishes instantly, instead of longer waits during drying. \n\n\n\n  Care Tips  \n\n\n\n  Cleaning.  The majority of floors today are sealed with polyurethane, so waxing is not necessary and could actually damage your polyurethaned floors. Dust mopping or vacuuming is usually all they need. For light cleaning, use a special professional cleaner such as Squeaky wood floor cleaner for polyurethaned floors. \n\n\n\n Beware of footwear hazards. Keep pumps with worn heels or sports cleats off your wood floors, as they can dent them. \n\n\n\n  Trim pets' nails.  Scurrying dogs and cats can do serious damage to a wood finish. Keep scratches at bay with a regular clipping schedule. \n\n\n\n  Flooring choices  \n\n\n\n Sprigg Lynn is president of Universal Floors in Washington, which has been in business since 1953 refinishing, installing, restoring and custom detailing wood floors. We asked him to choose three types of hard-surface flooring popular among consumers. \n\n\n\n  Bamboo:  Recently bamboo, which is actually a grass, has been a popular alternative to hardwood flooring because of its environmentally friendly properties and affordable price. The look of bamboo plank floors is unique, and the floors are durable and practical. $7 to $8 per square foot installed. \n\n\n\n  Wide oak plank:  Choosing a floor made of three-to-five-inch-wide oak planks assures you will see more of the beauty of the natural wood. A floor can be installed pre-finished with polyurethane coating (with limited color selection). Unfinished planks can be custom-stained in any color from white to black. Multiple types of finishes are available. $9 to $10 per square foot installed. \n\n\n\n  Hand-scraped wood:  Universal Floors offers an option called hand scraping that produces a floor that mimics the rich character of antique floors. Lynn calls it a \"footworn look for people who don't want their floors to look like they came out of a box.\" The look evokes the warmth of centuries-old floors. It is achieved through careful scraping with custom tools. It can be coated with polyurethane, although some prefer a wax or tung oil finish to preserve the patina. $15 to $20 per square foot installed. \n\n\n\n  Shop Smart  \n\n\n\n If you have old wood floors that are looking dull and scratched, consider refinishing. If both the finish and stain are worn off into the grain of the wood, it has to be sanded before applying new coats of polyurethane or wax. \n\n\n\n If you are shopping for new floors or thinking of re-staining your old ones, consider the pros and cons of dark vs. light floors. Dark floors are dramatic but will show pet scratches and dust and can make a room appear smaller. Lighter floors have a timeless look and hide dirt better; plus, they never look trendy. \n\n\n\n Buy some new doormats if you install new floors or refinish your old ones. If you keep a doormat in front of all the exterior doors to your house, it can help keep dirt from being brought in on everyone's shoes and wearing down your beautiful wood floors.

teachers strike leaves schools empty and parents struggling to find childcare options for kids who see it as another vacation. \n\n \n\n\n\n \t\t\tChoosing a college major: Parents have a balancing role\n\n \t\t\t“Morning wars” détente: Surviving bad socks and permission slips\n\n \t\t\tInfant sleep training news: 'Cry it out' does no harm\n\n \t\t\tChildhood obesity: Having \"The Talk\" with kids can head off trouble\n\n \t\t\tDisney: No more junk food ads for kids; and Mrs. Obama backs it\n\n \t\t\tDo you know your toddler’s \"slave footprint\"?  Mine has 20 slaves\n\n \t\t\n\n \"It was good!\" said Makayla, who presented her mother with a crayon picture of a school with a smiling sun, wearing eyeglasses, beaming down from a blue sky. \n\n\n\n But Makayla's mother, Latrice Hudson, worried about how long the strike that began Monday could drag on. As she watched her children play in a West Side park outside of Skinner  West Elementary School , Ms. Hudson confessed to mixed feelings about the action that involves some 29,000 teachers and support staff in the nation's third-largest school system. \n\n\n\n   RELATED: \"5 top childcare options - cost and value, from daycare to nanny\"   \n\n\n\n \"I want to be in support of the teachers but I really wish they could have found a different way to go about it,\" said Hudson, who is studying to be a teacher and had to rearrange her classes. \"I'm just hoping that it's over with by this week.\" \n\n\n\n Thousands of public school teachers formed picket lines in Chicago during the first strike in a quarter century over working conditions and benefits, as well as reforms sought by Mayor  Rahm Emanuel . The strike left parents of 350,000 students between kindergarten and high school age scrambling to find alternative care. \n\n\n\n The Chicago Public Schools opened 144 sites for half-day programs - providing food and activities from 8:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. About 60 churches also opened their doors to children from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Other parents have sought programs at regional parks and libraries, or kept their children at home. \n\n\n\n \"What we found from our calls is that parents just didn't go to work,\" said Cy Fields, senior pastor at New Landmark Missionary Baptist Church on the city's West Side, one of the churches that is taking in public school children. About 17 children were sitting in the cheerful basement kitchen of the church at lunchtime, eating sandwiches and drinking milk. Tables held board games like \"Connect Four\" and checkers, along with coloring and activity books. \n\n\n\n Mr. Fields said he expects more children at the church if the strike continues. While he thinks parents of younger children will find care for them, he is worried about teens in his violence-prone neighborhood, who are more likely to be left unattended and get into trouble. \n\n\n\n \"They may find themselves out on the streets,\" Fields said. \n\n\n\n DISAPPOINTMENT OVER IMPASSE \n\n\n\n At the Taylor Park field house on the city's South Side, parents dropped off children for movies, games and other activities while next door, at Beethoven Academic Center, elementary school teachers with picket signs marched. \n\n\n\n Most parents interviewed expressed support for the teachers, and teachers picketing were greeted with enthusiastic horn honking from passing motorists, particularly from unionized  Chicago Transit Authority  bus drivers. \n\n\n\n But one mother, who asked not to be identified, noted that she had to take cuts in her own pension and pay. \"The people at my job don't get to question their evaluation process,\" she said. A key sticking point in the negotiations is Emanuel's demand that teacher evaluations be tied to student performance on standardized tests, which the union opposes. \n\n\n\n Fields said he was disappointed but not surprised that the two sides failed to work it out. \n\n\n\n \n\n    RELATED: Are you a Helicopter Parent? Take our quiz!    \n\n \n\n\n\n \"Teachers deserve a fair contract, they deserve fair wages, they deserve fair working conditions. But the city and (the school district) have a fiscal responsibility,\" he said. \"They got to find a compromise. They both got to give up some skin.\" \n\n\n\n Teachers also have kids out of school. Catherine Schaller, a math teacher at  Beethoven , said she told her teenage son he could stay home while she picketed, but he had to study. \n\n\n\n \"I told him, keep on studying, whatever you were studying study some more, because that's what today is about,\" Ms. Schaller said. \n\n\n\n \t\t\tChoosing a college major: Parents have a balancing role\n\n \t\t\t“Morning wars” détente: Surviving bad socks and permission slips\n\n \t\t\tInfant sleep training news: 'Cry it out' does no harm\n\n \t\t\tChildhood obesity: Having \"The Talk\" with kids can head off trouble\n\n \t\t\tDisney: No more junk food ads for kids; and Mrs. Obama backs it\n\n \t\t\tDo you know your toddler’s \"slave footprint\"?
